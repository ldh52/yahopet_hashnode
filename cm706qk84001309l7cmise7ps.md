"It is a dog's natural instinct to mask their pain and discomfort until the disease has progressed," says Dr. Asaf Dagan, DVM, DAVBP, CVA, and co-founder of PetPace. "PetPace's proprietary continuous monitoring of critical biometrics enables the early detection of health problems that may have otherwise gone unnoticed. Other smart collars measure only a few vital signs, which are insufficient to accurately determine a dog's overall wellness or early warning signs," continues Dr. Dagan.

Only PetPace AI-powered smart dog collar provides immediate health alerts, continuous vital sign monitoring, proprietary wellness scores, and health comparisons based on their exclusive database. PetPace also provides goal tracking and GPS location tracking. It uses machine learning to become more intelligent with time as it continuously learns about the dog it is tracking.

"Tracking trends and changes across a range of health indicators can alert an owner when something is wrong with their pet's health, prompting them to bring their dog to a veterinarian before the situation becomes more serious," added Dr. Dagan. "It also enables the veterinarian to remotely assess the pet's condition using objective and accurate in its natural setting."
