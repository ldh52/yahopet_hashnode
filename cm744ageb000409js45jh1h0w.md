The personal impression I felt while watching the performance is that it is a precious performance prepared by many young people who love cats.

The talents of the Korean Arts Center were added to the love and love, and it was a romantic cat season 2 performance that warms the hearts of the viewers.

After the performance, Meow Park Sang -wook, the representative of the newspaper, heard about the explanation of the food service.It is said that the food service was prepared for the gil hunting without a place to go to the surrounding building.
