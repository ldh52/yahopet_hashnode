- I meet with White Swiss Sepford “Bolki” at Icheon Seolbong Park Grace Cafe
- Conversation about the right pet adoption culture and how to manage dogs

What kinds of breeds are there in the breed with white hair?Small and medium -sized dogs include Maltese, Bichon (Bichon Prize), Spitz, and Westy (West Highland White Terrier), and Great Pyrenees first comes to mind as a large dog.

Yesterday I met white Sepford at Grace Cafe in Icheon Seolbong Park, Gyeonggi -do.As you know, the usual German Seper is black, and the Seper I met yesterday was white.The name is Volki, and the exact name is 'White Swiss Sepford'.

'Sepford' will come to mind many people who think of the images of military dogs and police dogs.You will also be aware of courageous and loyal breeds.That's why it's common to meet Sepford easily.

The reactions of people who met Volki in Hajamin Seolbong Park were different.People gathered to see Volki, and everyone admired the handsome Volki's appearance.I also saw the white Seper for the first time, and I was admired from my mouth.Volki was well -trained, so people were still in place even when they approached.

Bolki is close to people because he is well trained

In 2017, he met a young Volkey at a pet shop in Japan.After the trip, I returned to Korea, and the appearance of Volki I saw at that time was stepped on and adopted around September.

Volimam lived in Japan for over a decade, and he explained the Japanese pet culture with the story of Volki.“In Japan, it is expensive to adopt dogs.The law is required to complete the Puppy Training Training, and to walk the dogs more than twice a day after adoption.So when a dog is broken, it is often occurring when the dog does not follow these provisions. ”

Japan has a demanding condition when adopting a dog as a pet to be with a lifetime.Bolkimam explained that it is necessary to be really determined and thoroughly prepared to take care of a pet like a family and one life.

In Korea, when a breed became famous through broadcasting, many people easily adopted the breed, and it was not long after adopting it.For example, the adoption boom was famous for the Great Pyreneyz, the Sanchae Chihuahua, which came out of the three -year -old, and the adoption boom.

“Appearance is handsome and cool, but it's a lot of hairs to manage, and the intestines are bad.As a dog to be together for a lifetime, I have to think deeply and fit as a family. ”
