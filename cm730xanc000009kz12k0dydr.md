Cheil Pet Foods is launching an Ideal Rexy Ultraskin Care, a skin disease prevention feed that helps to reduce allergies.

Ideal Rexy Ultraskin Care (hereinafter referred to as IR Ultraskin Care) is a hydrolysis feed that prevents allergies by breaking protein into small size amino acids and peptides so that the body is not recognized as an allergic source.In particular, it is characterized by the exclusion of allergies and the absorption of nutrients.The main raw materials were ease of worrying about the side effects such as decreased nutrient absorption rate and vomiting and diarrhea.

IR Ultraskin Care used an average of 500DA (Dalton) or less hydrolysis shrimp as the main ingredient.It excludes meat protein (cattle, pigs, chickens, etc.), the biggest cause of allergies, to help the dietary allergies and minimize the immune response in the body.Instead of raw materials that are likely to be allergic to corn, wheat, and soybeans, ancient crops such as clean rice, flax seeds, and sweet potatoes are used to help Moor and eye health.It contains high quality refined fish oil (EPA & DHA source), coconut powder, essential vitamins and minerals, allowing for nutritional supplies with only feed benefits.It also contains natural antioxidants, which can help prevent aging and improve immunity.

IR Ultraskin Care can be purchased at an offline store such as veterinary hospitals and pet shops.

Yoo Seok -ho, head of the pet food marketing team at Cheil Pet Food, said, “We have developed hydrolyzed feed IR Ultraskin Care to provide skin diseases customized solutions to dogs with dietary allergies such as skin diseases, eczema, and tear marks.”This is possible, so I expect a lot of attention from companions who think of dog health. ”
