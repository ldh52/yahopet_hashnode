There are three places of dog playgrounds operated by Seoul City, including World Cup Park, Children's Grand Park, and Boramae Park.Children's Grand Park, Boramae Park, which was closed due to the high satisfaction of the 'Dog Playground' in the World Cup Park, which was piloted in the winter, was opened early on February 2, 2019, and the New Year holidays ('19 .2.2. ~ 6)All of the places were opened.

One of the three places visited the dog playground in the Children's Grand Park.

If you visit a children's park dog dog playground by car, you can park in the parking lot.In Seoul, after a long time, white snow is scattered little by little.You can park your car in the parking lot, look at the Children's Grand Park, and look at the left side.

The Seoul Metropolitan Government announced that it is being reviewed because of the risk of accidents in the winter season because of the slope of the slope.If snow accumulates, it seems to be slippery because of the slope, as in Seoul's announcement.

There is a signboard at the entrance of the playground, and it is noticeable that it is 'prohibited from entering without a dog when entering the playground.'Looking at the contents, I think, 'It would be nice if people who came without a dog like us could enter.'What people who can't come without a dog are in contrast to the dog playground in the Goyang.When I visited the Goyang Dog Playground three years ago, I was able to enter the playground without a dog.As there are some people who are managed at the entrance of the playground, it is a good idea to allow access to those who wish to enter.

Operating hours are open 24 hours without a separate opening or closing, and can be used free of charge.

Below is a guide to the dog playground in Seoul.In addition, if you are a companion, you must keep the basic pet ticket.

The use of dog playgrounds can be entered with adult guardians for children under the age of 13 for safety.However, dogs, blind dogs, and dogs with estrus are restricted.The dog will bring the bowel bag and the collar to collect it when the feces occur and prepare for the dog's sudden behavior.

There are not many companions and dogs who have visited the playground because of their eyes.The Welsh Kogi, who came with the dog, welcomes.

After a long time, I went to a dog playground in the Children's Grand Park in the winter of February.There is a slope at the entrance, so in winter, the attention of children or the elderly is required.It is also good to note that you cannot enter without a dog.There is an administrator at the entrance, but it is necessary for everyone who visits the pet ticket.
