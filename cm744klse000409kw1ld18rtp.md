As the Namhae -gun entered the winter after the full -fledged winter, Namhae -gun guided the confirmation of long cats and asked the people to cooperate.

First, if the kitten is not severely dried or wet, the mother is likely to have been temporarily emptied for feeding activities.

Second, cats basically don't like strange smells, so people should not be stroked because they touch the kitten and throw away the smell of the cub or ask and kill them in severe cases.

Third, according to the Guidelines for Operating the Animal Protection Center (Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs), cats less than three months old, which are separated from their mothers and are difficult to live on their own, are included in the scope of protective animals, but most of them are not sold.Do it.

An official from the Namhae -gun said, "If you look at the kitten crying on the road, you want to bring it home right now, but if you bring it, you can separate your mother and baby."
