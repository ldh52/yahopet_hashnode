Pet natural food brand 'Hug' announced that it has launched a pet premium homemade snack 'Terrism'.

In April, the Hug launched a premium pet natural food 'reproductive teacher' and launched a pet natural lactic acid bacteria 'fermented vegetables'.

This time, 'Territary' is a total of seven flavors, which consists of Daegu, black pigs, turkey, salmon, horses, crocodiles, and ostrich.In particular, the name of the product called 'Terriers' was created by combining Terrine (Terin), which means minced meat or meat mass, and 'Delicious', which means 'delicious'.

Jung Yoon -kyung, head of the marketing team at the hug, said, “There are many products that contain various chemical additives such as preservatives, artificial pigments, and synthetic fragrances.”"It is a safe and healthy snack for pets by consisting of seven protein sources with low occurrence factors."
