Gwangju Metropolitan City has recently been accelerating the expansion of animal welfare infrastructure in the era of 12 million pets (350,000 people in Gwangju).

Gwangju City is investing 3.9 billion won to systematically manage increasing organic animals, and is promoting the construction of a “wide -area organic animal protection center” of 1780㎡ (600 protection).

In addition, in order to fundamentally solve the problem of organic animals that occur more than 8 cases per day, the organic animal adoption center and pet culture classes will be operated in Nam -gu next year.

The Organic Animal Adoption Center is operated by introducing organic animals that are protected and managed by the animal shelter, providing opportunities to meet naturally and find new families.

The Pet Animal Culture Class is a pet health and behavioral correction, and a pet ticket (a compound word of pet and etiquette) programs to prevent laws and organic animals.

In addition, next year, the company will create a 4000 square meter “pet -only playground” in the mining district.

The creation of a playground for pets is expected to resolve related conflicts and have a play area for pets to play.

In this regard, this project is considered to be an excellent example of animal welfare public -private cooperation in that Gwangju City reflects the results of the 'animal welfare governance', which is a participant of animal welfare experts and related private organizations.
