If I suddenly need to be caught in Corona 19, I will be worried about how to do a pet -like pet.

As a result, Gyeonggi -do announced on the 17th that it will operate the Corona 19 -confirmed pet temporary protection service, which temporarily cares for pets on behalf of the Corona 19 confirmed, with 31 cities and counties in the province.

This service is based on the promise that Governor Lee Jae -myung promised that the difficulties of pets due to Corona 19 will be taken together.The purpose was to concentrate on it.

Earlier, the governor said on the 1st of his social network (SNS), “I have to be hospitalized for quarantine with Corona 19 confirmation.It's hard to live without someone's care, ”he said.

In particular, if the confirmed person is a single household or the family is confirmed, it is intended to prevent it from being left alone in a pet left alone in a family if it is not easy to find the help of the surroundings.

The target is a temporary protection of the Corona 19 confirmed coronar in the province where there are no household members or acquaintances who can take care of pets (dogs and cats).The protection period is from the date of discharge from the date of receiving the inpatient treatment notice.

The protection procedure will be provided by the Corona 19 confirmed person through the public health center and applying for a temporary protection service, and the relevant city is connected to the designated shelter (cooperative animal hospital, etc.) to support safe transfer to care services.If necessary, treatment such as vaccination is also performed.

In particular, the designated shelter will conduct pre -disinfection to prevent the disease from infecting the disease, and to separate the protection space of other animals.

Temporary protection numbers have no restrictions.However, as a temporary protection cost, 35,000 won per day must be paid, and detailed costs may be different for each shelter.

The province plans to continue the service until the Corona 19 situation is terminated.
