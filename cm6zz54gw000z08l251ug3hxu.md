The designation of the global veterinary industry as an essential service through 2019 and 2020 has largely nullified the effects of the coronavirus pandemic on the veterinary ophthalmic equipment prospects for 2021. Rise in urbanization, and the trend of humanizing pets along with growing awareness about ailments such as glaucoma, cataract, macular degeneration, and retinopathy, are key aspects discussed in the veterinary ophthalmic equipment study by consulting firm Fact.MR. The study recalibrates pre-COVID-19 estimates, on the basis of broader developments across the pet and animal husbandry industries.

According to Fact.MR, the market is estimated to surpass a value of US$ 785 Mn in 2031, achieving a decent growth rate since 2016. Bodies such as the American Animal Hospital Association and the American Veterinary Medical Association have collaborated to provide guidelines for telehealth practices for small animal clinics. These changes in veterinary practices are anticipated to fuel developments for veterinary ophthalmic equipment to minimize any detrimental impacts arising from the pandemic.

According to Fact.MR's analysis, canine and equine species are most commonly affected by ocular issues. This is especially true in cases of traumatic eye injuries and ocular setariasis. On the other hand, cases of corneal opacity were more commonly observed among buffaloes and caprines.

According to a report by the Indian Veterinary Research Institute, ocular issues were more common among animals in the age group of more than 5 years. Also, eye disease occurred more frequently among males in canine and equine species, and females for cattle species. These are essential factors that are expected to drive developments in the market in the coming decade.

"Rising awareness of among pet owners about animal health issues including infectious diseases and changes in cultural influences towards humanization of pets are expected to fuel the growth of the veterinary ophthalmic equipment market. Ease of access to medical information and details about professionals over the Internet are factors supporting long-term growth," says a Fact.MR analyst.
