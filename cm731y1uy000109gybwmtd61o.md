I received a nice mail today ('19. 2. 14).Even after a year, it's not easy to get a welcome mail.

The story of receiving the mail is as follows.

Not long ago, I introduced the article “Sweden's Pet Smart Puzzle” in Sweden.It was a common toy in pet fairs and pet shops, but it was a toy that contains a lot of meaning in it, and it was a Swedish product.

The Eagle was given by an editor Jennifer of Jen Reviews.The place where Jennifer is in New Zealand is the contents of the mail.“I recently wrote a recent article on how to choose a dog toy on your Dog Advisor homepage.

“Of course!”It's a short English, but I'm happy to reply.And look at what the homepage is called 'Your Dog Advisor'.

"wow!"I see these sites for the first time.

I have seen a similar American site.It was a way for pet professionals to post by day, and many readers visited, and all of them were Americans.

The word “Wow!” Came from my mouth because of this “your dog advisor”, unlike the American sites, not only Americans but also people from all over the world participate.The United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, Portugal, Scotland…

Not only Americans but also people from all over the world are participating together.

There are also various jobs for participants.Veterinarian, Dog Beauty, Writer, Photographer, Dog Trainer, Ph.D., Veterinary Technology, Traveler…

Their pursuit is expressed in one line on the homepage, saying that 'Our Mission is to the Trusted Authority on Dogs.'The homepage contains the articles needed for companions and prospective companions to take care of the dog.These articles…It is written by experts after carefully reviewing research.

The most authoritative advice for dogs in the world is 'Your Dog Advisor'.

Looking at this homepage, 'If you have a site in our country…I think.

On a single topic, can experts by sector present and review each other and express them in one article?In order to do that, the collective interests of their representative groups may be damaged.

As the contents of the e -mail, can a veterinarian, dog beauty, writer, photographer, dog trainer, doctor, veterinary technician, traveler, etc. can express the results in one article.It is not easy for many experts to gather in one place to exchange opinions.Even if the meeting is a cyber space.It's even more surprising that this difficult work is done in a place called Your Dog Advisor.

For example, American sites wrote in specialists in each field and the day of the week.But today's introduction is about one of the experts.This will be distinguished from the US site, and it can be said to be more prestigious than other sites.

Isn't it the same as your dog advisor, which is not in Korea?

It seems to be great lucky to meet overseas sites because of the fact that the article introduced by chance was introduced through the Yajoppet.The really precious relationship comes to this chance.

It is not gorgeous or noticeable, but it is written by linking the homepage of 'Your Dog Advisor' and your dog Advisor.
