In life, there is a sense of distance between what you know and what you do, the distance farthest from the earth.The areas that frequently encounter this distance are health care, environmental protection, and diet.And unfortunately, vegetarian diet exists at the point where these areas overlap.

As humans are not reasonable, they are rationalized, and cognitive dissatisfaction, which does not lead to acting, is convenient and easily organized through rationalization mechanisms.

However, if it is not a strictness of the consensus, but even if it is a bit of a crackdown, it means to change the world and the world, isn't the occasional occasional events that are not everyday that life leads to life?

This book is sometimes successful even if it is successful, but it talks about large gray vegetables.Most of them know, try to try, but fail to fail, and lower the eye level of the hardships defined by failure, and remind them of the value of vegetarianism as much as possible.It is good because there is no need to be very determined.

School violence is no longer surprising.

Children and youth literature also deals with things that seem to have become everyday.However, it is not easy to meet the works that go beyond the surface phenomenon, to look at the other side, cover the surrounding surroundings, and to capture the changing children.

The work that did such a difficult work is 『Morning in the Moon』.It's a picture book, but it's like a novel, so it's a book that wants to attach a genre of 'picture book Noble', the title of 'Tiffany in the morning', and the motif in the movie is used.As you can see, it melts naturally throughout the story, causing deep and warm repercussions.

The strategy of animal humanization, such as a bear that is harassed and a rabbit that is suffering, is novel and appropriate.Most of all, the ending of sharing the friendship of rabbits and bears is hardened and mature.I would like to recommend not only children who are painful because of friends, but also shaking adults.
