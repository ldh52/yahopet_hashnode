It is the 'Infinite Imagination Citizen Park' in front of Uijeongbu Station, where you can enjoy your beloved dog and Ojun walk.

I have an appointment nearby, so I visit the park that is full of autumn light for a while.

The art camp in the park also has a Holowin atmosphere.Infinite Sangsang Art Camp is a festival held at the Uijeongbu Art Camp for the enjoyment of cultural and arts for citizens of Gyeonggi -do.

This month, a festival will be held under the theme of 'Urban Garden' and 'Halloween & Harvest Feast' of Infinite Imagination Citizens Park.Wow, wooden dolls and dolls 'friends' Halloween stories will be broadcast, and from 2 pm on Saturday, the monster syndrome of the extreme tree will be broadcast.

Next to the art camp is a variety of flowers that blend with green light.The plants in harmony with high buildings are impressive.In the park, there were people sitting in the chairman and talking with dogs, people who enjoyed walking with dogs, and those who took care of the garden.

If you live nearby, you can enjoy the Oki walk with your dog.If you are not with your dog, you can go shopping at the department store next to you, and you can explore the books you have seen in Yeongpung Library.

If you come by car, you can use the public parking lot or department store parking lot next to the park.It was a little over 3 pm when I took a picture, but it was shaded by the building.As the weather gets colder, the park visit is good to visit around the sunny morning or noon.

Why don't you go out to Uijeongbu, northern Gyeonggi, on the end of October?A little bit different from everyday life.
