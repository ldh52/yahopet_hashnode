On October 19, 19 (Sat), the first half of the festival was held in Gunsan Dogland.'Banjaja' is an abbreviation of the 'one of the companions', and this event was a festival for the activation of animal sympathy with organic dogs.

Gunsan Dogland, where the event is held, is an organic dog protection facility with no euthanasia and a large lawn.

At the event, the Happy Love Sharing Bazaar event for organic animals was held, a seminar for the spread of the correct pet culture, and an evening concert with pets.

I have seen Gunsan Dogland, which I heard only in words.Looking at the Dogland in the actual field, I think I know why this place is called Tierheim of Korea.

After seeing the seminar, you want to see Dogland before the sun goes down.On the day, Kim Kwan -young, a member of the right future party, visited Dogland to see the festival, and looked around the facility and talked about Lee Jung -ho and organic animals.

You can see the organic dogs who are working freely on the lawn.Some are crowded, and some dogs enjoy the time alone.

There were many dogs in the gravel yard across the street, and they spent time with Dogland visitors.

The dogs that are excited and run, the dogs next to them and playful dogs like a young child.The appearance of organic dogs meet in this environment…It's unfamiliar, but it's good to see.

The large external environment is amazing, but the sight of the indoor silk is amazing.

A window that looks bright, bright light, spacious space, pleasant air and temperature…It is a pleasant environment where the dogs can play and relax.

There were indoor and playgrounds on the hills, centered on the Dogland Convenience facilities, and the grassy playground and the dog pool.There is a lake outside the front yard fence, which seems to make Dogland's scenery stand out.

Looking around the Dogland facility, the sun goes down and the surrounding area becomes dim.After the seminar, the concert was held.At the concert, US troops working in Yongsan visited Dog Grand to celebrate significant events, and there were orchestras after the exciting performance of the singer Lia.The story of 'Evening Concert with Pets' will be introduced in detail in the next article.

Tierheim of Korea, Gunsan Dogland…There was a Dogland where many organic dogs lived in Gunsan, Jeonbuk.If you visit Dogland today, you can see the dogs who play with the crowds in the open natural environment.

Gunsan Dogland is said to have seven employees, including Lee Jung -ho.It is not easy for seven people to manage these wide sites, but I think it will be able to maintain this environment because it does not artificially control organic dogs.

The images that come to mind when 'organic animal shelter'…Perhaps if you have been to organic animal volunteer, most of them will come to mind.Sticking the nose, the narrow fence that restricts the activities of the organic dogs, and the dogs that bark loudly…But in Gunsan Dogland, I could not find this.

'What should be the organic animal shelter?'If you are a question, you can find one of the answers in Gunsan Dogland.Gunsan Dogland is a good example for government departments, companions, and animal rights groups that are concerned about animal rights and welfare.
