Microbiom -derived exosomes have been found to be effective in improving inflammatory bowel disease. Prosstemics (203690) research team (first research institute Choi Hye -in) is a Lactobacillus exosomal obtained from microbiomes.In the long -term disease animal model, it proved the anti -inflammatory effect by suppressing barrier strengthening and inflammatory cytokine expression.The Pros Stemix is ​​an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) treatment (IND) in 2021.It is currently working on a preclinical stage with the US clinical trial agency (CRO), and the results show that the improvement of IBD, a refractory bowel disease, reached more than 80%, especially the microbiom -derived exosomes.As the world's first attempt in the world, it is receiving great attention from academia.Prodymix has 21 patent applications and 8 registered patents.It is said that the gastrointestinal transmittance rate is better, and it is expected to accelerate commercialization due to small side effects.It is expected to grow rapidly to about 70 trillion won by year, and this paper has been published in the latest issue of BIOMEDICINES, SCI -level international journal, and the Impact Factor, which is a journal influence index, is 4.72.
