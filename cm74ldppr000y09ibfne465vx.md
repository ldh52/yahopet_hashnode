On July 16 (Thursday), I met ROH's representative of ROH, who is a dogwalker in Pyeongtaek.

"This child is a dog 'Sabu' who crossed the Rainbow Bridge in 1998."

Roh, who has lived in the United States for 31 years, tells the story of a dog's father and tells the story of a pet culture in New York.Dogwalker Roh, he was a national team player who spread our taekwondo to New York.

When he visited home for the interview, he first introduced his dog.Sadfu crossing the rainbow bridge 22 years ago.

Roh showed the remains with the photograph of the master.Isn't it amazing?He still keeps the ashes of dogs who crossed the rainbow bridge 22 years ago!

Roh, who lost his dog, suffered the pain of Petros, and he did not see other dogs for seven to eight years after his father -in -law left.The pain of Petros was so great, Roh says.

"I was able to adopt my wife, give birth to a child and adopt it again after a long time," he says.

As I talked about my dog, I was able to listen to the pet culture in New York, USA.

The story of an organic animal shelter that adopted a master who was an organic dog, a dogwalker who visited his companion family to walk his dog, New York's pet crematorium and a cemetery story, and a walkway in New York where he was walking together.It was amazing that there was a pet cemetery in New York.

In Korea, local residents need to be supported by opening a pet funeral home.Therefore, it is unimaginable to open a pet funeral facility in the city center.In the case of New York, on the other hand, there are pet funeral facilities and cemetery in the city, so it can be seen that the gaze of pets is very different from us.

With the story of a dog's father, I could hear the story of Roh who lived in the United States.

Representative Roh introduces a golf club found while repairing a 200 -year -old mansion when living in Vermont

Roh mainly lived in Manhattan in New York.There, Taekwondo stamps were opened, and Taekwondo worked hard to spread.At one time, the family moved to rural Vermont and lived there, and he found an old golf club by repairing a 200 -year -old mansion.Unlike golf clubs these days, I can see the header of a golf club with wooden shafts and round circular shapes.

Roh says he said that he was a part -time job in Manhattan as a young man.He gave his personal findings about pet culture.

"There are three elements that dogs are essential for dogs. That's what to play with the dogs, the dogs, and the dogs," Roh says.The three elements that Roh explain are as follows.

- Walks are essential for urine and socialization.
- The reason why the owner should stay together with a lot of time ... Dogs need socialization, but they instinctively do not want to fall from the crowd.Therefore, it can be a fear for dogs to fall and fall from a group.The dog follows a person from the instinct that it does not fall from the crowd.Even if a dog is with other dogs, people must be together.The reason is that no matter how perfect, you are anxious if you are alone, and even if you are with other dogs, if you don't have a companion, you will be part of dogs, not dogs.(Socialization can be made in the direction that your companion doesn't want.)

- Dogs should play with dogs.

And Roh gave his feelings about the pet culture of Korea, which he felt in Korea for a year.

"Our country looks at a dog from a person's point of view. In the United States, we think about the relationship between a companion and a dog from the dog's point of view."

"I've been to Korea to buy food. When I go to buy the food, I have a question first at the store, which is, 'What's the breed of raising?'Doesn't it seem to be a natural word?But you will be embarrassed with empathy.

- Representative Roh: "It's a mix dog"
- Store owner: "Then, feed 8,000 won."
- Representative Roh: "It's Jindo Dog."
- Store owner: "Then feed 20,000 won here"

"In Korea, only obedience is looking for" ...

Not all domestic pet culture is, but why is Roh's head nodded and sympathetic?The domestic pet culture in the eyes of Roh, who lived in the United States for a long time ... I think it is our figure that we knew and did not feel it well.

Earlier, the story of a dog and a pet culture of the American pet culture could not be listened to the pet that Roh thinks about the culture.However, Roh was so keen to insight into the cross -section of the domestic pet culture and had a passionate heart to present a solution.

Roh has lived abroad for 31 years and has spread Taekwondo abroad.The companion who always has the remains by the dog's memories with his dog.Dogs want to revitalize Dogwalker culture in Korea!

The conversation with Roh made a lot of things to think about the reporter.The story of the pet's pet in Manhattan, New York, is expected to be our pet story soon.And I think it would be nice to have a person like Roh at the center.I would like to thank Roh for explaining our pet status and the direction of development with broad insights.
