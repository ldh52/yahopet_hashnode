Taconic Biosciences, a global leader who supplies animal model solutions for new drug development, will launch a COVID-19 research ACE2 mouse model.The SARS-COV-2 virus, which causes Covid-19, has ACE2 receptor.Introduce the cells through.Because the mouse and human ACE receptors are different, general research Miss cannot be infected with SARS-COV2.Human ACE2 receptor expression transition Miss can overcome this problem and is therefore essential for Covid-19 studies.The taconic HACE2 AC70 mouse model is easy to infect the SARS-COV2 and can express symptoms after infection.The animal model plays an important role in the development of new drugs, from basic disease features to preclinical safety and efficacy tests.Although the development of SARS-COV-2 vaccines is in progress, a new animal model that can be used in various new drug development is needed.Successful global vaccines take time and they do not protect 100% from disease, so there is a desperate need for continuous research on the treatment of covid-19 patients.The HACE2 AC70 mouse is worth it because it can be used in both early and late stages of new drug development.An expert from the World Health Organization (WHO-COM) recently written in Nature in relation to the Covid-19 modeling (WHO-Com) “It must continue to develop and improve the animal model for COVID-19, which should contribute to the development of vaccines, therapeutic agents and other measures to establish various measures."It can be."It will provide researchers around the world with the essential tools developed.Currently, the waiting list of our company's client is over six continents, which reveals that the demand for the Covid-19 animal model is high. ”For more information about Bioscience's Corona virus toolkit, please call or e -mail.
