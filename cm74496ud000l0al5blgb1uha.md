- Contributing to preservation of biological resources by preventing the death of wildlife in the waterway

The National Institute of Ecology (Director Park Yong -mok) under the Ministry of Environment recently developed an experimental device that can help escape the escape of amphibians and reptiles that are died of drainage and will be prototyping the escape experimental device within 2021.

The National Institute of Ecology has conducted an empirical study on the escape test of wildlife (amphibians and reptiles) to reduce the damage to amnests and reptiles that occur in concrete drainage through 2018 since 2018.

The National Ecology Center is to study whether the efficiency of the escape ramp installed in the conventional concrete agricultural and drainage through the study and to escape the specific behavioral form and probability of amphibians and reptiles in the waterway.The experimental device has been developed and the patent registration has been completed.

*Patent Name: Escape Experimental Device (No. 10-2177254, November 4, 2020)

The escape experimental device is designed to easily set and control the detailed conditions necessary for the escape of amphibians and reptiles, such as the expansion of the ramp and the flow of water, in response to the various environments of the concrete artificial waterway with the escape route.

In addition, there is a variety of sensors that can measure the movement and escape of frogs and snakes in the 'escape experimental device' to scientifically verify the escape behavior and escape of small animals in the room.

The National Institute of Ecology provides a scientific basis for the water -escape design standards presented in the Ministry of Environment's' Installation and Management Guidelines for Installation and Management Guidelines for Establishment of Ecological Passenger Route (Ministry of Environment, 2010) through research using patent technology, and the number of excellent water -to -efficiency and economicsIt is expected to contribute to development.

By 2021, the National Institute of Ecology will develop a prototype of the escape experimental device and develop an improved number of evacuation devices that reflect the results of the research, and will discuss with the relevant agencies to apply it to the road project site subject to the environmental impact assessment follow -up.

Park Yong -mok, the head of the National Institute of Ecology, said, “We will continue to work to protect biological resources that disappear through various development projects through empirical research.”I will try to contribute. ”
