The event was held in the order of a happy love sharing bazaar event for organic animals, followed by a seminar for the spread of the right pet culture and an evening concert with pets.

At the beginning of the concert, there were greetings such as Kim Kwan -young, a member of the National Assembly, Kim Jong -sik, and Dogland Representative.

I'm not very happy when I close my eyes later?There were people who were happy to be happy, so the last song of this song was also a dog.Don't forget you and my heart.
