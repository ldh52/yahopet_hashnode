If you go to Konkuk University, you can meet a unique theme cafe Meer Cat.He is told not only to dogs and cats but also to raccoon and Meercat, and he heads to the Meerkat Chief.

Get off at Konkuk University Station by subway and walk a little bit.When I opened the door and went inside, two dogs were welcomed, as in the dog cafe, and the Labrado Retriever and Welsh Kogi.

He greets two friends and pretends to know, and another friend is welcoming.Someone looks, it's raccoon.I went to a few cafes with raccoons, but I don't think Raccoon is greeted.

Sit on the table and look at the animals of the Meercat.

Puppy and Raccoon

Raccoon, which has been seven months now ... I'm playing with a Retriever friend.Welsh Kogi, who played together, leans on the floor and looks at the Meercat friends.

Still young raccoon…He is curious and is said to be not only for animal friends but also for guests.If you are caught by Lee Sang -jin, a shameful joke, you will be hugged for a while."Please hug you under the navel," said Lee Sang -jin.

I remembered the seven months of my dog's dog and Alpha.This seems to be the right word.A world with curious eyes…Lee Sang -jin is said to not force young raccoons.

Lee Sang -jin said, “I can train raccoons to be polite and follow to the guests, but I have seen a lot of cases where stress worsens as I grow up, so I do not forcibly train them."

Cats live in Meerkat Village.The nest was twisted in a high place, and it came down and interacted with other animals.

These are the Meercats of the Meercat.Lee Sang -jin, who said that he was adopted by an acquaintance five years ago, was an opportunity to live with Meercat.It is said that the young Meercat was raised every three to four hours.The Meercats of the Meercats are said to be descendants of the Meercat.

You can meet Meercat directly in the Meer Cat Room

Meercat looks at one side like a military training with his paws.I saw it on TV.In other unusual theme cafes, it was separated from Meercat and humans, so we could not touch the Meercat.So…I was a little embarrassed to say that I could be together in the Meer Cat Room.

I don't know how much I was sitting in the Meer Cat Room.At first, the first time I saw it on my knees and smelled it, I smelled it, and as time went by, I was so conscious of 'you, I, I'.

I want to take a picture with my cell phone, and it's amazing and look around and play around.It is not cute to see a joke with a mild foot.

Animal hospitals that look at the health of Meercat family animals

I talked with Lee Sang -jin about the part of the animal rights.Lee Sang -jin says, "We have our own community, keeping the rules to be kept, and we are trying to enrich the health and behavior of animals."It is a unique theme cafe that exhibits the Igzotic Animal, and the part of the animal is as follows.

The health of the Meercat family animals is said to be inspected periodically through the cooperative animal hospital.Cooperation Animal Hospital includes the Acris Animal Medical Center, Hanyang Animal Medical Center, Ida General Animal Hospital, and Wellness Clinic Center.

The Meercat Chiefs pays more than a certain level for animals.Therefore, it is said to be more expensive than ordinary feed.

The space where Meercat lives is said to be placed on the floor at night, and the next day the guest is removed.

In order to create an environment similar to health care, feed benefits, and wild in animal rights, the officials of this field, including the Meerkat, are working, Lee says.

As I stayed with the animals, it quickly passed.Meercats naturally do what I know that I don't harm them.The guests turned, and the Meercat Chiefs had only animals, me, and Lee Sang -jin.

Labrado Retriever and Welshko are lying on the floor.Cats are in the house and are coming down the table.Raccoons don't accept Rabrado and sit in one place quietly.Meercats are moving the busiest among them as they sit down.

As I sat still in the Meer Cat Room, I thought, 'People and animals can be like this.'Rabrado and Welshkogi, who are played by raccoons and raccoons, and cats watching them from above, and Meercat and me…

Someone did it!The best trained dog is Go who lived in a rural grandmother's house.Recognizing the existence of each other, coexisting, symbiosis, living without being conscious and especially conscious.

I think I saw it in the Meer Cat Chief today.Meercat is small, so it's hard to play together, so I'm just living with a separate wall.Puppy, cat, raccoon…I lived together like a friend.

A companion who lives with a mirror, raccoon, dog and cats, who have been raising milk since childhood, can understand the heart.Lee Sang -jin, who is making a cafe by making Meercat Chiefs and Meer Cat Village!

If you are ready to understand and accept nature, reality, animals, people, and as they are…I think it's good to travel to Meerket Village.Meercat, dogs, cats, and raccoons live together.
