3D bio -frying company T & Albiofab (CEO Won Won -soo) has obtained a domestic patent for the manufacturing method of animal tissue -derived biomaterials, accordingly, animal tissue -derived biomaterials and three -dimensional printing methods.This patented technology is a technique of manufacturing a biomaterial that includes a process that can selectively remove the acidic degrading enzymes used during the manufacturing process of animal tissue -derived biomaterials.It can be used as a medical material for human transplantation.The acidic decomposition enzyme is used as a substance that facilitates the formulation in the manufacturing process of the external material (ECM) -based material, but when the residual residues, the cell toxicity appears.It may cause side effects in the human body, so it must be removed in medical materials.In the past, there was a technical limit that it was difficult to selectively remove acidic degrading enzymes in the manufacturing process of materials, but this patented technology of T & Albiopab exists on biomaterials.The key is that it can selectively remove acidic decomposition enzymes while preserving the microstructure and physiological components.The company predicts that the technology will be a key technology for the development of medical devices with the development of medical biomaterials and the reconstruction and regeneration of organizations using them.It is a strategy to secure high -efficiency biomaterials that contain cell external quality (ECM) and biochemical factors (growth factors, etc.).there is.As a result, the company has achieved an important technical pleasure to ensure 3D bioprinting and reverse stem cell technology, as well as the source of technology that leads to another core of biomaterial technology.We are preparing to apply, T & R Biofab is based on 3D bio -printing technology based on 3D bio printing technology, bio -ink for biodegradable medical devices, organization and long -term bio printing, organoid for in vitro test, Long -term analogs) and 3D printing cell therapies are research and development.
