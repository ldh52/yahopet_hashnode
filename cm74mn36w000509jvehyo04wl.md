On July 3 (18), the Korea Pet Industrial Retail Association (Chairman Lee Ki -jae) visited the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry in Sejong City.This is because there was a meeting with the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry Animal Welfare Policy Team (hereinafter referred to as the Policy Team).The meeting was created by the government as a place that was requested to explain the overall situation of the pet industry, which is becoming increasingly in the swamp of recession, and requested to seek the cooperation of the government.

The reporter will introduce one of the many stories that came and came on this day.It is a story that Iguana disappeared in the Korean reptiles.None of the readers do not know Iguana.There were not a lot of pet shops that once handled Iguana.Iguana was very exotic and unique, and was the most popular pet among reptiles.For this reason, Iguana appeared in various media and was a filial pet in the reptile market, which can be found in large marts pet corners, coronary specialty stores, or the Internet.At that time, the sleeves were also formed for about 12,000 won, so anyone could raise it casually.

However, Chairman Lee Ki -jae, who attended the day, told the policy team that "the current recession is never the atmosphere of the country," and "some government's wrong animal protection policy is also helping."

How did the Iguana market disappear?

In 2013, with the revision of the Animal Protection Act, Iguana and other reptiles and amphibians were also designated as targets for animal protection.This was natural and welcomed.Although it is a small animal, it is a strict creature and must be respected.That way, the family who raises pets will also be aware of the dignity of the lives of pets.However, as the animal protection law was revised in 2015, Iguana's import requirements and breeding requirements were greatly strengthened.

Perhaps public officials have listened to the stories of many groups to revise the Animal Protection Act, and somebody would have claimed it for example of developed countries, and it was not accepted.

On this day, Chairman Lee Ki -jae said:

“In order to import Iguana or 4 million won, the area that can accommodate them needs 300 pyeong.Otherwise, the Ministry of Environment could not give an import permit.And even if you earn diarrhea, consumers were also a problem.In order for a consumer to raise iguana, there was a space of 3-4 pyeong for each one.If you break it, you can get a fine or sentence.In other words, no importers or consumers can bring in iguana, breed, or pets.This law is for dogs or tombs, but I think it was just comfortable.Anyway, three or four companies that imported domestic reptiles have stopped imports, and the related goods market also disappeared.Eventually, as of 2018, Iguana disappeared in Korea. ”

In this way, Iguana's reptiles have disappeared from Korea.In fact, the reptile market is a very important market.Historically, the pet industry has a development stage.Starting from the first time, it develops into special animals such as ornamental fish, dogs, sesame seeds, ribbos, reptiles, amphibians, insects, and pets, crocodiles and snakes.Korea is now in the cemetery market and now progresses to the reptile market.

But the problem is not just that Iguana has disappeared.It is difficult for the pet industry to breathe due to the non -realistic animal protection method.As the market of Iguana disappeared, our pet industry is afraid of getting smaller.It is not the logic of the market, but by the sophistication of the equation.
