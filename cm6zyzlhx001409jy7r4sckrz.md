The ultimate pit stop! MCR, the fourth-largest hotel owner-operator in the United States, has acquired the 167-room dual-branded Tru by Hilton Smyrna Nashville and Home2 Suites by Hilton Smyrna Nashville in Tennessee.

The hotels are located less than 10 miles from the Nashville Superspeedway, the internationally renowned motor racing complex with the oldest continually operating track in the United States. On Saturday, June 19, the track hosts the NASCAR Xfinity Series race, its first NASCAR event since 2011. And for the first time in 40 years, the NASCAR Cup Series comes to Middle Tennessee with the Ally 400 race on Sunday, June 20. (It’s Father’s Day weekend — hint, hint.)

Minutes from Nashville International Airport as well as downtown’s restaurants, country music venues and honky tonks, the Tru and Home2 Suites are ideal places to park for the inaugural NASCAR Cup Series weekend. Before hitting the Superspeedway, fuel up with a complimentary breakfast. Or take a coffee for the road!

Put pedals to the metal in our fitness centers, both of which have cardio machines, free weights and virtual personal trainers. Or head out for some fresh air: Smyrna has 10 parks and seven miles of greenway trails!

While in town, drive by the Nissan Smyrna Vehicle Assembly Plant, which pumps out 640,000 cars per year!

Be sure to signal before you go: the plant plans to offer tours for car enthusiasts in the future.

After your adrenaline-fueled day, hit the brakes in the hotels’ heated outdoor pool. Or play billiards in Tru’s colorful lobby. Need a nightcap? Grab a beer at Tru’s 24-hour market — or whip up some grub in a Home2 Suites kitchenette.
