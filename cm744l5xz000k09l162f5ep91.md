Incheon Gyeyang -gu (gu chief Park Hyung -woo) will start the online pet class on December 9 to prevent conflicts between those who raise pets and those who do not.

The pet class has been receiving a first -come, first -served basis at Gyeyang -gu Office website since November 23rd.It consists of four lectures on the topic of 'Education Law to Chosen Dogs', 'Being Best Protector', 'Dog Health Care', and 'Common Sense Must Know'.

Gyeyang -gu opened the “Dog Shelter” for the first time in Incheon in May 2018.Since 2019, the pet class has been held for free of the dog shelter, but the pet class has been converted to Corona 19.

Anyone who raises pets can apply and tuition is free.At the Society of Social Animal Behavior, Incheon Social Animal Behavioral Medicine, one -on -one online zoom video class teaches for 1 hour and has a 30 -minute question and answer time.

A former official said, “We plan to create a happy Gyeyang -gu where animals and people coexist together by operating pet classes. We will continue to develop and operate various pet -related programs.”
