I visited a story pension located in Bongpyeong -myeon, Pyeongchang -gun.The wide swimming pool in the first sight is impressive.The story pension that you meet when you go by car along the road seems to say, "Come."

It's been a while since the first snow came, and there's a small snowman at the entrance of the parking lot, welcoming the winter of Pyeongchang.

It's close to Phoenix Park, and I'm wondering which stories will be made in the story pension and this winter story pension.

'Saint Hill…Is it the hill of the saint? 'The characteristic of St. Hill is that the building is built along the hill.Looking at the pension building, I felt that I made a good use of nature.
