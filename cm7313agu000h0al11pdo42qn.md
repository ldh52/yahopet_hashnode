Yoon Kyung, who is selling a pet -only villa 'Petheim', introduces the reason why the pet house needs and the elements that the pet house should have.

The following is the first part of the blog that explains the need for the pet house.

Dogs and cats, who are representative of pets, were originally wild animals.The wolf has begun to evolve to dogs hundreds of thousands of years.Cats are argued exactly when they have been tamed to people.The remains of the oldest cat found in human tombs were 9500 years old.It is also claimed that humans have raised cats to get rid of rats that eat grain as they settle in agricultural society, and archaeologist cypress claims that cat jaw bones were found at the first settlement of mankind and lived with us from the time of collection.It is also done.

I don't know how the pets around us have evolved, but we can see that it has not changed much from wild animals in appearance or behavior.

The inside of the pet is potential for wild instincts.

Since civilization, human residential forms have changed rapidly.

In particular, the types of residential forms in the usual apartments and villas we know these days have become a stressful environment for pets.This stress may reduce our children's unwanted diseases and lifespan.

â€‹

Therefore, a residential environment is required to suit the characteristics of pets.The residential environment is divided into three categories.

i) Structure for pets

ii) Structure for guardians

III) A structure for others who live together

Yoon Kyung -kyung says, "The residential environment needed for pets should be considered for pets, guardians, and people who live together."There are many factors for the pet house that lives with pets, but Yoon Kyung introduces 24 of these to the blog.

The pet house consideration elements introduced by Yoon Kyung are as follows.

In Yajoppet, we plan to look at the Pet House Goryeo elements with Yoon Kyung Co., Ltd.Yun Kyung's pet house 'Petheim' is scheduled to open around March 2021, and related news can be found through blogs and cafes.
