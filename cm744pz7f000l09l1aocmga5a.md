I have been to Gyeongju Dang Dog (Tokyo) in Icheon, Gyeonggi -do.

It is characterized by our traditional dog dogs, no tails or short.When I went, there was a mother and a son.Hopi's dog is the mother's private arc and the blackgu is the son.

When I raised a race dog, it is not so much more amid than other dogs.But it is said to be close to people, loyalty, and courageous.I was next to me while touching it nearby.I thought it would be a bark or stranger, but I welcomed you to any other dog.

If you take a walk to walk, it runs like a shot in the mountains, and hunting for the mountains and squirrels in the mountains.

Our traditional dog dog, race dog!It was good to see people living happily with people.

Korean traditional dogs include Jindo Dog, Pungsan Dog, Sapsal Dog, Fire, Jeju Dog, and Gyeongju. Unlike other dogs, there are not many sites known about Gyeongju dogs.The dog is said to have been sold for 20 free sale.

I hope we can see our traditional dogs, dang dogs, which can be familiar with people.
