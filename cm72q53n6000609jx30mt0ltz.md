The Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs (Minister Kim Hyun -soo, hereinafter referred to as the Ministry of Agriculture and Food) supports adoption fees for those who adopt organic animals to respect life and to spread the right pet adoption culture.

While the number of organic animals increases every year, the adoption rate of organic animals is in stagnant trend, and it is to activate adoption through the cost support required for adoption of organic animals.

* Loss / Organic Animal Status: ('16) 90,000 → ('17) 103 → ('18) 121 → ('19) 136 * Adoption Marisu: ('16) 27,000 → ('17) 31 → ('17) 31 → ('17)'18) 33 → ('19) 36 Anyone who adopts organic animals protected by the Animal Protection Center designated by each local government can apply to the relevant city, county, or ward office.

After receiving an adoption confirmation from the Animal Protection Center, you can complete the animal registration, fill out the adoption fee, and apply for within 6 months after adoption to the relevant city, county, or ward office with the Animal Protection Center or Animal Protection Center.

However, the support items are built -in animal registration costs, beauty expenses, etc., and if you apply with the receipt, you will be supported up to 100,000 won per mari.

* Support contents: Neutralization surgery expenses, disease treatment expenses, vaccination expenses, built -in expenses, beauty expenses ** If the adoptees spend more than 200,000 won as a support item, the government supports 100,000 won, and depends on the conditions of the local government.In some cases, it is necessary to check the exact amount of support for the city, county, and ward office.

For more information on the adoption and adoption costs of organic animals, additional information can be found in the Animal Protection Management System (www.animal.go.kr).

Ahn Yoo -young, director of the Animal Welfare Policy Division, said, “I hope that many people will be interested in adopting organic animals to respect life and to spread the right pet culture.”

"Next year, we plan to simplify the support process by increasing the amount of support for adopting organic animals, reducing the required documents to make it easier to apply for adoption costs, and introducing non -face -to -face application methods using emails and faxes," he said..
