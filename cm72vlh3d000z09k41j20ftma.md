Initially, the broadcast emphasized the fact that the excessive walks of the young Pungsan dogs are animal abuse, and that it is a shortcut act of prohibiting animal rental projects under the animal protection law, and reported it.Even if you look at the broadcast report and the homepage of the company, the fact that it is for commercial experience business using animals seemed clear.

Care was prohibited from the Animal Protection Act, so even if it was a legal act that was rented in the name of an experience in the field, it was a violation of the law so that these moods were not spread.

⠀

However, if the abuse of more than a decade before the accusation, at least tens of thousands of citizens of citizens had experienced and returned, the abuse that harassed animals was bothered in the middle of the day.It was questionable that care was not in the fact that there was no knowledge or discussed among animal groups.

In addition, after recent reports, many companions have been able to climb to the Blue House petition and the local government homepage server is paralyzed, but even though there are no animal groups who have been on a field survey, Care is no longer judged by broadcast reports.I concluded that on -site investigations are essential to find problems that can be more inappropriate and more.

Although it was already reported on the broadcast, some problems may be private, so it could be difficult to investigate properly, but nevertheless, I thought it was inappropriate for animal organizations to conclude by broadcast without seeing the site.We thought that if we leaned on the investigation of care and approached the unexpectedly, we could look at the many spaces, observe the state of the dogs, and ask them from various angles through interviews.

⠀

When I arrived at the site, the experience project was tentatively stopped.Shortly after Care arrived, the officials of Anseong City Hall came to the scene separately from Care and interviewed for about an hour.In the field, about five young dogs were playing or sleeping in a relatively large fence, and the staff walked through the trails with 3-4 dogs and dogs.

⠀

Care has grasped various things through two more than 2 hours of interviews with two representatives of Pungsan Gae Village and on -site surveys of every corner of the world.In conclusion, Care requested a complete and permanent interruption and a public interest business of the for -profit business.

⠀

The company promised that 'unfortunate that our business is not properly conveyed on the broadcast, but no matter what, we will not be able to do business under the name of experience.'In addition, we will make a profit structure with a public business model so that we can contribute to society, and we promised to create and switch programs through continuous advice and monitoring of animal organizations.

Below is the results of the survey of care.

⠀

1. Environment, health status, breeding, business structure with dogs

⠀

Business structure and animal environment

The father of the current representative who made Pungsan Gae Village in Anseong has been proud of its pride in Pungsan dog, a native dog, and has been reproducing and selling for about 25 years with the goal of preserving Poongsan Dogs.In addition, these Poongsan dogs will be made into a local specialty tourism project, and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and Anseong are supported and expanded to the experience project.

Currently, the dogs have been maintained by about 30 populations, with about 30 Pungsan dogs running around in less than 300 pyeong.There was no form of floating that can be seen in dog farms and local government shelters, and it was separated into two spaces, which were separated from the interior and spacious playgrounds, and the dogs were playing and playing.

⠀

Care position

However, Care opposes the classification of dogs to satisfy economic needs and tastes, and is being campaigned as another kind of discrimination.Therefore, even though the representative of Poongsan Dog Village breeds for the purpose of preserving the lineage, the number of mari sold per year has helped to mass -produce organic dogs with irresponsible companions in Korea.The dogs with the dogs have been rescued due to abuse, and after being rescued, it was not possible to adopt.

He also explained the serious situation of the domestic dogs, and showed the field structure of care of care that the lineage of Jindo and Poongsan was overflowing on the dog farms and slaughterhouses.

⠀

Company position

The company has been raised healthy and healthy with special attachment to Poongsan dogs, and has been strictly sold and acceps dogs that have been raised so far.I promised not to do it as it is now.

This part needs meticulous progress and change, so we continued to meet with Care to think about the business shift.I did it.

2. Principles such as the age of the dog, the number of mari, and walking time of the dogs used in the experience

⠀

Company position

Originally, the dogs who were selling were needed to check the adoptors well, and the training of the characteristics of Poongsan dogs and the tutoring of pets has been expanded to the walk experience project.

The puppies decided whether to take a walk according to the condition and condition that day, with an average of 1-2 times a day, and must have a break after the experience program.Therefore, experienced visitors had a waiting time for 1-2 hours and up to 3-5 hours, and sometimes they could not keep the rest time due to a step mistake, but the dogs have to rest well and have fun.no see.

The young representative emphasizes that the experiences have been important and have always been improved by monitoring various opinions so that the business continues.In addition, minor children could not be lined up, and they could not hold their dogs, and they guided them from touching them when they were sleeping.The lead line was educated not in front of the puppy, standing next to or behind, so that the puppy was followed in the direction of the puppy.

This means that visitors' blogs come out, so that the dogs did not walk for more than two hours, allowed the water to be fully, and to sleep or rest on the way.

⠀

Care position

There are also cases where ordinary dogs insist on not going for a walk.It is difficult to conclude that only one scene is forced to walk and abuse animals.However, what seems to be a problem in the company's claim is that two hours of walks can be overwhelming for young dogs.

Care also operated an adoption center, so I had to take a walk for a volunteer program by walking several times a day.There are cases where volunteers are insisting on not going to go, and they have talked about the experiences of walking for a walk.

What is more important than the simple problem of dragging and not dragging is that young dogs' appropriate exercise time, and various problems that can occur when the project continues due to profit, that is, the project, which is a profit structure even if it is a walking experience.It should be more noted that it is not overwhelming and that this project may survive and similar businesses can be difficult.

Care emphasizes this point, and once again, it will inform many citizens of the complete interruption of the for -profit business, the mature dog culture and the reality of various animal species, and cooperate with each other to develop better programs to expand animal rights, and to breed.The company promised not to do it as it is now, and the company promised to accept all of them and decided to minimize it with a line that maintains only the breeding of Poongsan dogs, but this part will continue to meet with animal organizations.

Lastly, the company has said that the company reflects on the fact that the dog did not manage more careful about the difficulties that the dogs seemed to be difficult.

⠀

Finally, Care asked what the pictures of the Pungsan dogs are pulled out of the media.The company was planned as a poison sports that entered the PyeongChang Olympics about 15 years ago with the Korea Sleepdog Federation.
