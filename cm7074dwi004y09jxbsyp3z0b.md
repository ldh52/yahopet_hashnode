BARK (NYSE: BARK), a leading global omnichannel dog brand on a mission to make all dogs happy, today announced its pivotal role in developing the pet product industry's first international safety standard for dog toys and unveiled a state-of-the-art dog toy testing lab, which sets a new benchmark for safety and quality in the pet product industry.

About BARK

Leveraging more than a decade of expertise and a deep understanding of dog play styles and preferences derived from designing thousands of dog toys, BARK began building a dedicated toy safety testing lab in 2022.

The lab is equipped with advanced technology that mimics real-world use, focusing on chomping, dropping, pulling, and general wear and tear.

With oversight from BARK Director of Safety Brian Grochal, the lab rigorously tests and evaluates BARK toys with accurate dog jaw replicas designed to simulate chewing, tugging, and thrashing from various breeds, such as Pitbulls, Chihuahuas, Boxers, and German Shepherds.

Since the lab opened, BARK has completed over 2.5 million individual chew cycles, about 30 days of aggressive chewing per toy, and is on track to test 1,500 toys by the end of 2024.

Grochal, an award-winning safety and standards executive who was named chairman of the inaugural subcommittee on Pet Product Safety by ASTM, a world-renowned international standards organization, is leading a group of manufacturers, retailers, testing labs, veterinary professionals, consultants, and consumers to define the safety standard for dog toys sold around the world.

In his leadership role of the committee, Grochal has been instrumental in establishing industry-wide best practices for design safety for dog toys, as well as other dog products, and those built for cats, birds, fish, reptiles and more.

"There are more than 40 safety standards for various children's products in the U.S. alone, yet there are zero safety standards for dog products," said Brian Grochal, BARK's Director of Safety and Quality. "This work is long overdue and it’s an honor to lead the committee in building out a portfolio of safety standards that protect our non-human family members."

BARK's approach to safety is grounded in various team members' extensive background in children's toy design from prior roles, as well as the knowledge and preference data from serving 6.5 million dogs since BARK's founding in 2011.

This unique combination has informed the development of comprehensive testing protocols and drives our commitment to creating the safest and most enjoyable toys for dogs.

BARK's team of inspectors completes more than 2,000 inspections each year, evaluating over 800,000 toys for even the most minor imperfections. This rigorous quality control process ensures that every toy BARK produces meets the highest safety and durability standards.
