- It looks like Korean beef, cow, and goat.Methane Reduction Technology Universal Application

The Rural Development Administration analyzed the methane saints on the rumor of Hanwoo, cows and goats.

The Rural Development Administration (CEO Hur Tae -woong) analyzed the difference between the livestock by analyzing the methane saints (microorganisms producing methane) in the rumors of Korean beef, cow, and goat.

Many microorganisms live on the top of the animal, and helps to digest and absorb animals.At the same time, methane, a greenhouse gas that causes a greenhouse effect by polluting the atmosphere in the intestinal fermentation process, is also produced.

The types and composition of the ruminous methane bacteria of ruminants such as cattle and goats can vary depending on the method of developing livestock and feeding feed.

In order to regulate the recombination methane production, detailed information about the microorganism is required.

In the meantime, the domestic research on the rumant methane saints has been limited to Korean beef, and there was no comparative study between livestock.In this study, we used metagenome techniques*that analyzes not only a species of genome but also various kinds of microorganisms in the environment.

* A study that defines important species that determine the characteristics of this group in the microorganisms, viruses, and fungi in certain samples, and compares the microorganisms in other conditions to identify species that determine the difference in characteristics.Research on next generation sequence analysis (NGS)

As a result of the study, the methane saints of the ruminants raised in Korea confirmed that there were three inside in Korean beef, four in cows, and three in the goat.

* Biosclassion: Kingdom, Phylum, River (Class), Order, and Family, 屬 (屬, Genus)Species)

All three cattle, cows, and goats were all metanobrevibacter, which accounted for more than 94% of the metanobibacter bacteria.

* The bacteria that occupy the largest or largest or large area of ​​the crowds within a certain range.

Combined with livestock, methane, Sungpyun Cluster (unit: genus)

In other words, there were methane -producing dominant bacteria of domestic ruminants.This suggests that developing methane reduction technology for uthology can be applied universally.Kim Sang -ho, manager of the National Livestock National Livestock Science Institute of the Rural Development Administration, said, “The results of this semi -breeding methane life by the livestock are expected to be a beneficial basic data for establishing a methane reduction strategy.”

"We will continue to do research to reduce greenhouse gas emissions of ruminants in response to climate change."
