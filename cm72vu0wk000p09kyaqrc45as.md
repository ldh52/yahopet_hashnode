The Cheongju City Livestock Division announced on the 29th (Thu) that the satisfaction survey of the 2020 student riding experience project will be conducted from the 2nd to the 22nd of next month.

The student riding experience has been closed due to 19 coronas, but the project is being carried out with a safe horse riding experience after receiving the online application and compliance with the rules of defense according to the revision of the student riding experience.

As a result, we have been conducting a survey of student riding experiences, which have been in effect since 2018, this year, and the participation is 1105 students and parents this year.

The survey will identify the overall satisfaction of the student riding experience project and reflect it in the next year's project by collecting various opinions on the project.

Cheongju -si Student Horse Riding Experience is commissioned and operated at Juseong -dong Napa Valley Horseriding and Nangseong -myeon Taesan Riding Town.

An official from Cheongju City said, â€œStudent horse riding experience is a project that affects positive growth through words, and we hope that we have been strengthened to the students who are tired of Corona 19."
