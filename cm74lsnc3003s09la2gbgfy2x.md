In 2012, the 1st Pet Animal Manager Job Training Photo

2012 was the year of a pet manager.At the time, the term 'pet' was not commonly used, and I did not know the difference between 'pet' and 'pets', and did not know why the two terms were different.

When the word pet was first used, there was another word that spread throughout our society, which would say, "In 2020, the pet market size will reach 6 trillion won."

'Pets', '6 trillion won in market size' ...

'Pets' and '6 trillion won' ... I personally think that these two words have the biggest impact on the pet market from 2012 to the present.

Wasn't it a frog in a well looking at the pet market?

Today (February 18) I accidentally read the following article.

'Teacher Group, last year's sales of KRW 1.45 trillion' 'The largest since its inception' (Financial News, February 13)

Looking at the title of the article, the word '6 trillion won in the pet market' overlaps ... I felt dazed for a while.

According to the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, the pet market in 2018 was 2.89 trillion won.And the size of the pet animal market in 2020, which everyone expected, is far below 6 trillion won.

Who predicted the size of the pet animal market and presented it in the past when it was over 10 years old?'6 trillion won', which has become a pronoun, and the word 6 trillion won would have been dreamed of startups who are trying to enter the pet market, but the people who actually experienced this market would have had a great sense of frustration and disappointment as the size of the dream..

'Pet animal market size of 3 trillion won and teacher group sales of 1.45 trillion won' ... Teacher Group generated half of the pet market size.

Who is the protagonist who makes pet markets?

I opened a pet newspaper and met people in various fields.Experts in the field were trying to further enhance their expertise, and as the perception of animal welfare increased, the level of consciousness of companions was improved.

The idea of ​​'lack of cooperation and understanding in the field of pets is a personal opinion that you have over time.

Those who have long worked in the pet field, and those who worked with their dogs, call this field 'open'.And the negative perception of the 'edition' is full of thoughts.'The game is originally like this'…This is not so often that I hear it occasionally.Perhaps for a long time, the cumulative bad aspects of the rivals and competitors have left negative images to workers in this field.

Workers in this field faced their heads and they were awesome.Wasn't it because of that '6 trillion won'?

However, the 6 trillion won was not a reality, and it served as a catalyst for heating competition by inducing new competitors to enter the pet market.If you do not claim that only your own thoughts and items are right, the next day you will fall behind in the competition!

In front of that reality, we may have eyeed 'right'.And I ran to the competition for competitors.And culture was formed by experts in such pets.

You have to raise your eyes accurately looking at the times

I want to listen to the news of the Teacher Group in Financial News.'Red Pen' is a news that the company and teachers that come up with sales of 1.45 trillion won a year.

'What was the members of the teacher group?'Think about it.They would have united for one goal within the group, and would have read the changes in the times and prepared there.And the result is an annual sales.

Pet animal market…Isn't the people working in this field, like the members of the teacher group, are all together with a big boat called 'pet'?Needless to say, if the pet field is divided into a more professional field, isn't the people who are working there as the same members as a faculty department?

If the members of the same boat are in four divisions, they will be unhappy without seeing the ship.This extremely natural word…It is a pity that it is in the current pet field.

Like the indigenous people in the movie Apocalypse, it is a fight against each other without knowing that a powerful army of foreigners flock.

Now it is time to survive only to understand and cooperate with each other.Pet workers are trying to prevent large companies from entering the market, but internal harmony is not good.It's just a fight of rice bowls.At that time, someone unites each other to analyze trends and prepare for the future.

Development is based on mutual cooperation, not competition.

Pet market size of 6 trillion won…

The subjectivity of the first predicted people caused a bubble in the pet market for more than a decade, and people laughed and cried.No, there seems to have been more people crying.'Dreams Come True', did you say dreams come true?We have been running in 2020 as the size of a pet market of 6 trillion won.'Why not?'

It is time to improve professionalism and to read the trends of change.It doesn't work now or now to stop the huge waves that come.It is now necessary to study how to avoid the waves, to minimize damage, and to study how to cross the waves.To do this, it is necessary to be able to accurately measure how much power the waves have.

Only me, I can't see the huge waves that come to me if I look at me.Banking of the groups who help each other and coexist, and prepare for the falling waves.It was 2020 in need of this posture.
