On July 13 (Sat), Osan Early Birds Pet Care and students practiced illustration with Park Jung -ah.Prior to the practice, students who had theoretical classes of various pet culture from Professor Pet Care and Professor Lee Dong -hyun heard the explanation of illustration and practice tips from Park.

I went to the training with a brief explanation of the illustration practice time, the first class.I grabbed the composition and looked at the picture I chose.

Based on the experience of studying abroad in Japan and teaching students, Park Jung -ah gave 1: 1 guidance while the students practiced.Students who have been having a hard time studying schoolâ€¦For this time, I seemed to forget all the world's anxiety and to draw pictures.The picture he painted was proud of the picture and the true appearance of the youth growing up in it.

There are also various fields in the animal art field, but today students have experienced illustration.I also understand that many writers are active in this field.

Students with various reactions such as 'It is not easy to draw a picture than you thought' and 'It is fun to draw pets with pictures' finished the semester pet care class after the illustration practice.

Students who have visited organic animal shelter, pet -related departments, shopping malls, hospitals, and animal rights groups.These students will have grown into the best junior experts in the pet field based on the things they have experienced and felt at the time.
