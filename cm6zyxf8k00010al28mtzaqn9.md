Veterinary professionals from around the world will convene at VMX 2021, June 5-9 live at the Orange County Convention Center (OCCC) in Orlando and everywhere virtually, to learn the latest in diagnosis, treatment and specialized procedures in animal medicine.

The North American Veterinary Community (NAVC) today announced more than 650 sessions will be taught and presented including: separation anxiety in a post-COVID world; feline and canine obesity challenges; and new options in cancer treatment for dogs. VMX, the world's largest and most comprehensive global veterinary education conference, is hosted by NAVC, the global leader in continuing education (CE) for veterinary professionals.

"VMX provides the forum for veterinary professionals to learn and stay abreast of the many advances in animal medicine that are helping animals live longer, better quality lives," said NAVC CEO Gene O'Neill. "With the NAVC's first virtual extension of VMX, veterinary professionals everywhere will now have the opportunity to learn from and engage with the world's most renowned experts in veterinary medicine. They can also explore our award-winning VMX Expo Hall, network with colleagues and enjoy great entertainment wherever they choose -- in person in Orlando or anywhere online."
