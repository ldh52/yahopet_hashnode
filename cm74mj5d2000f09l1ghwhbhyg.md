From June 4 (Tuesday) to 16th (Sun), 2019, the 'Me, Cat' was held in Paled Seoul in Seochon.The 12 writers who love cats gather together to hold the exhibition, and take the subway and get off at Gyeongbokgung Station to Paled Seoul.

Arriving in Paled Seoul, I visited the works of artists on the first basement to the second floor.The exhibition room on the first floor ... while looking around the works, I met a cat inside the exhibition hall outside the door.

After looking around the work, I was wondering what the cat I saw earlier, and I asked Kang Hye -young curator who planned the exhibition.

"I saw a cat earlier, do you have a cat?"

"It's not one, but there are several people, please introduce you? Would you like to see you?"

Kang Hye -young curator will show other cats.

In the words of Kang Hye -young curator, I want to have a few more cats.

As you approach it little by little, you can see the cats who take a break in your home.Walk carefully and take a picture to avoid rest.

"I had two dogs in the past, and I crossed the rainbow bridge, and I saw the cats coming to the gallery, and now more than 30 road cats are looking for this place."

A river curator usually asks visitors not to access the long cats.Today, thanks to a friend I met by chance, I was lucky to see the nest.

With the hope that the awareness of the cat cats changes, the exhibition planners and artists who like cats are gathered together.There are people who love long cats like Kang Hye -young curator, and artists and visitors who like cats.After stopping at the exhibition, I met a wonderful work, and I met a long cat family who was cared for by Kang Hye -young.

The exhibition will be held until 16th.I would like to visit Paled Seoul before the end of the exhibition and find out the behind -the -scenes stories contained in it.
