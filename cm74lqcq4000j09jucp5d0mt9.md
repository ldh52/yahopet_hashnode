Congratulations (CEO Sang -wook Yoo, Gangneung Pet Love)

Thank you for your dear residents, and all the people who attended this place, and everyone who attended the busy schedule.

Nowadays, due to the increase in the number of single -person households and aging, the department has been operated due to a population increase in dogs in Gangwon -do, and more than 10 million people live with pets.With the rapid economic development, pets that soothe the loneliness and always look at me in a society where only the economy exists have become a companion who lives with the world.Now I can't imagine that I can't imagine that I can't imagine it.

But most people are inevitable to break up with pets who live fast.But someday it's going to come to us, so keep your sorrow and pain away and send your pets well.Knowing how much sorrow and pain is such a breakup with pets, our pet love employees will do their love and sincerity with their families like the last beautiful farewell.

Pet love will provide integrated services from pickups to commemorative, admission, and cremation for the leading role of pet funeral culture, and from Bongandang, which places pet remains.

Pet love is a year -long consultation and funeral, and you are the choice of customers for the basic makeup costs.Only individual makeup is executed under the companion, and the entire process is designed to be directly visible, and CCTV recording 24 hours a day.We will proceed cleanly and quickly using eco -friendly makeup and the latest memory stones.

We will grow into pet love, which is recognized as the best effort and integrated service for beautiful farewells with pets.

Lastly, thanks to all those who participated in helping the disadvantageous neighbors to donate rice instead of the wreath in the ceremony and to deliver them to Gangneung -si, and to all those who attended this place today, and good luck in your family.I wish you together.Happy New Year in the long -awaited year.thank you
