This Summer, ESKA will relaunch ESKA Sparkling using 100% recycled plastic bottles.  For ESKA, this marks the complete elimination of all first use plastic bottles across its entire product line – a commitment made with the transition of its natural spring water bottles to recycled plastic in 2020. In fact, ESKA will be the first leading Canadian brand to make carbonated water bottles with recycled plastic.  ESKA Sparkling is carbonated natural spring water available in Original and natural Lemon, Lime and Orange fruit flavors.

이번 여름, ESKA는 100% 재활용 플라스틱 병을 사용하여 ESKA Sparkling을 출시한다.

The recycled plastic in ESKA's spring and sparkling water bottles are sourced from Quebec's Blue Box and other recycling systems. The rPET bottles are themselves recyclable, which is part of the brand's commitment to environmental sustainability and contributing to the circular economy.  In fact, these recycled PET bottles in turn become new bottles, that means continuous reuse – an idea that ESKA calls the "Recycle of Life".

"Preserving and protecting the environment is a core value for ESKA," says Michel McArthur, the company's Chief Operating Officer. "We are truly proud to have successfully converted 100% of our bottles to recycled plastic while maintaining a premium product from a glacial esker," he concludes.  "We will no longer use any new plastic in the manufacturing of our bottles."

Crafted by the source

Sourced from a protected spring, ESKA's natural spring water has been filtered by nature for over 15 years. These ancient Canadian soils have created a natural filtration system that gives ESKA a uniquely fresh, clean taste. In fact, ESKA natural spring water is so pure that it goes from the source to the table with virtually no human intervention. For ESKA Sparkling, the only thing added is natural flavors and carbonation.
