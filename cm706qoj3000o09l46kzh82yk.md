Inc. magazine revealed that CityVet is No. 123 on its fourth annual Inc. 5000 Regionals: Southwest list, the most prestigious ranking of the fastest-growing Southwest private companies, based in Arizona, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas.

Born of the annual Inc. 5000 franchise, this regional list represents a unique look at the most successful companies within the Southwest economy's most dynamic segment–its independent small businesses.

On receiving the recognition, CityVet CEO David Boguslawski says, "We are honored to be recognized by Inc. as one of the fastest-growing private companies in the Southwest. 2023 was an exciting year with expansion into two new markets (Houston and Austin) and continued growth within our existing communities. This year we are thrilled for even more growth as we bring CityVet to at least four new states in 2024."

Boguslawski continues, "This achievement is a testament to the hard work and commitment of our team members, who strive every day to provide best-in-class care to our clients and their beloved pets. Kindness is the cornerstone for everything we do at CityVet and we look forward to continuing to add like-minded veterinarians and individuals to our team as we grow."
