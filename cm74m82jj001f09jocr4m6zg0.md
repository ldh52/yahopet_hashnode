Yoon Kyung Co., Ltd., a company that studies pet residential culture, introduces the 'elements that the pet house should have' on the website.In the Yajoppet, we look at what these elements are.-Addivier Note-

hello.

Looking at the external activity facility of pet housing

Pets instinctively have areas.However, if you are in a narrow room, you will be stressed, and if you accumulate, strange behavior occurs and leads to disease.

If you are indoors, you can show abnormal behavior with stress.

Especially in the case of dogs, you must take a walk.In foreign countries, walking for dogs may be defined as laws.I don't think it is a kind of abuse to walk.

​

Most cats are often done indoors without walking.You may just want to go outside, and you must have a collar/body.You may be able to go into the mountain and lose it.

The effect of the walk is as follows.

First, it strengthens the ties between the guardian and the pet.

It acts like a guardian and follows various instructions and relies on the guardian in an unfamiliar environment.

Second is good for the physical health of pets.

The nozwalk smells various odors and ensures the normal function of the sensory organs.

And by running and walking, you can bring about body development.

Helps physical health

Third, it is good for mental health of pets.

For children, even if the house is not a studio, but a large apartment does not feel much different.The house is limited to children's activities.If you are in the house, stress will accumulate and you will do abnormalities.

Through a walk, you will be satisfied with the marking behavior that displays your area and your area.And it is the instinct of children to do bowel movements from their homes and far away.

Helping mental health

This effect should be done every day, but the lifestyle of modern people is often poor.

​

There is a lack of conditions for our children to walk freely, such as the lack of walking space in late work, the shortage of walking space in the city center, and a park that prohibits dogs.

​

In Petheim, the building is mainly used to create a play area using the rooftop.

Of course, the natural environment such as mountains and fields is good, but in the city, it is almost limited.

​

Used freely without external interference

Petheim creates such a Dog Run that can be used freely even in late hours after the day.

The space to be with these dogs is

First, you can use it freely without external interference in time.

Second, not only dogs but also guardians are close to the guardian's rest.

Third, it ensures the safety of outside activities.When walking in unproven places, it can be infected with various contamination and germs.Petheim can prevent infection from this outside and guarantee safety from people who threaten pets.

Security for external activities

There are several considerations in this activity space.

Sufficient space, eco -friendly materials, lighting, triumph facilities, appropriate rides, and separation facilities that are not harmful to the body.And there should be a soundproofing facility so that it does not harm the house.

​

Dog Run and Pet Run should be a safe and safe and happy space for pets and companions.
