The Nobel Prize for Chemistry of the Year awarded by the Royal Nobel Prize in the Swedish Academy of Sciences was awarded by the CrispR (Clustered Regularly Interspached Short Palromic Repeats).Genetic scissors technology is a technology that corrects specific areas of DNA in all living things, and is used for disease treatment, animal and crops, etc., and is simpler and more sophisticated compared to existing genetic scissors technology, so it is called a revolution in biotechnology.It is a future technology.The National Forest Service National Forest Research Institute (Director Jeon Beom -kwon) said in the forest field that it succeeded in creating a genetic correction tree using genetic scissors technology for the first time in Korea.As a result of correcting a genes similar to the Phytoene Desaturase 3 (PDS3) in a popler tree and correcting it with genes, white hyperlipidation (albino) population is created.It takes more than 20 years to select this good tree and determine whether the trees grown in the seeds of the next generation have excellent traits.On the other hand, using genetic scissors technology can be accurately corrected only for a particular purpose, and can be improved in a short time as a tree with useful and excellent genetic traits.It is applied to crops.Unlike crops made of genetically modified methods (GMOs) in the United States, crops developed by genetic scissors (canola, soybeans, etc.) have been excluded from regulations and are being used commercial use, and genetic correction studies such as the US and ChinaIn the country that leads to the number of genetic scissors for trees, this study is likely to be a bridgehead to secure global competitiveness in the field of genetic scissors.The manager said, “If you apply genetic scissors technology, you can also create new genetic trees, such as breeds that endure environmental stress or changes in the ingredients in wood.”We look forward to seeing our breeding sectors in Korea. ”
