On October 19, 2019 (Sat), he stopped at the first half of the festival held in Gunsan Dogland to explore the organic dog shelter and watched the dinner with pets.It's a long way to go home with the course on the day, so I stay in Jeonju for one night and get up the next morning and head to Jeonju Hanok Village.

When I searched the internet, there is a dog -friendly restaurant called 'Veteran' in Jeonju Hanok Village, so he drove his car and headed to Jeonju Hanok Village.

Taste a bowl of kalguksu in the veteran

Arriving in the veteran and entering the store, the dog is not visible.'Geumgangsan is also the aftermath of the meal' and ordered a bowl of kalguksu.Kalguksu with perilla ... The taste is excellent.After the meal, I asked, "Can I come with the dog here?"

Dogs meals are available in veteran annex.

I went to the annex side, 'There!There are companions who eat with their dogs. '

You can eat with your dog in the veteran annex

You can see the companions who visit with their dogs and eat deliciously.When I asked a guest, I replied that I first came here.It is not a good idea to meet a dog with a dog, which is not a rare dog.

Looking around the annex and walking to the parking lot where the car was parked, I naturally visited Jeonju Hanok Village.

The appearance of people dressed in hanbok

As I walked through the streets of Hanok Village, I noticed the people dressed in hanbok.Looking around, there are hanbok rental stores everywhere, so I seemed to have rented here.

The people riding on the electric bike and the bike rental station

On the street, the pairs were also seen in the bike rentals and bike rentals.

There was a sacred girl middle school opposite the veteran.The scenery was beautiful like a park in harmony with Jeonju Hanok Village.

You're on a straight road where you can see the game.With a neat image, you can see a shop selling Korean fruit, Jeonju Choco Pie Headquarters, and an old -fashioned cafe.We are, but we have never seen it around.Very impressive.

Awareness of the road before the game

It would be nice if there were many buildings around us where you can feel the curve of Hanok.As I walk along the shining streets under the sunshine of autumn, I reach the game before the game.There was a flea market next to the game, and handmade works of artists in this area were on display.

Last winter, I traveled to Jeonju, met with Park Eun -jung, chairman of the Korea Pet Nutrition Association, and also stopped at Jeonju Walk Animal Hospital, Korea's first pet book store in the veterinary clinic.

This visit to Jeonju was not for travel, but I am happy to see a lively local culture in Jeonju Hanok Village.Since it is lively and bright, I want to recommend Jeonju Hanok Village as a destination with a dog.

Travel with dogs,â€¦It would be nice to visit Jeonju Hanok Village to enjoy cute streets and shops, and to eat 'veteran' to eat Jeonju's style.In addition, if you are preparing for a dog hanbok, you may be able to wear a fine hanbok and walk the street.

Why don't you go on a trip to meet memories and new things to deliver in Jeonju Hanok Village?
