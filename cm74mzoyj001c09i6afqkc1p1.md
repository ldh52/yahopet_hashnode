Project background

In Article 98 of the Civil Code, there is a legislative legislation on [definition of goods], which is a provision that applies "property loss crimes" to the perpetrators when injured by animals.However, according to Article 98 of the Civil Code, all the animals in Korea, including long cats, zoo animals, and pets of our family, are treated as “stuff”.

Kim Ha -yeon says that the society can create a “coexistence” society only by finding their minimum rights in the law, so that animals can have dignity as a noble life.I hope to change the legislation by all of them together with one mind, 'animal also has the right to have the dignity of life like humans.'

Kim Ha -yeon said, “I hope this project will be interested in this advertisement by many people who pass through the subway history.It can be said that the amendment will be submitted and passed through the precious vote of the people in that it will be made before the proceeds.Many people will be together. ”
