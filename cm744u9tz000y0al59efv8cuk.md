Konkuk University's Industry -Academic Cooperation Group (Director Song Chan -sun) is one of the livestock disease response technology development project (organized by the Agricultural Forest Food Technology Planning Institute), establishing an early forecasting system for infectious diseases of the livestock, and implementing free online education for the prevention of foot -and -mouth disease and foot -and -mouth disease.This technology development project was conducted on a joint research by the Konkuk University Veterinary Research Team (Professor Sang -Seop Nam) and the Konkuk University Teachers' Education and Engineering Research Team (co -research director Park Sung -yeol) and finally completed the project until DecemberBased on the results, it will be fully service from 2021.The high -pathogenic avian influenza and foot -and -mouth disease, which are the first livestock infectious diseases that have continued to occur in Korea since the 22000s, live a large amount of livestock to block the spread of disease due to strong infectious.It is causing huge social and economic damage of tens of billions of won every time, such as the disposal.In addition, due to the decline in productivity due to the decline in productivity due to the decline in food shortages in the future, the importance of early prediction systems of livestock infectious diseases is increasing in that it is required to reduce the damage caused by this.There is a 'poultry infectious disease early forecast system' to discover influenza infection early.In other words, in order to recognize whether the poultry such as chickens is infected with high pathogenic avian influenza, it is a system that measures and transmits the body temperature and noise of poultry through the deterioration camera and a silencer in time units.The measurement device and data consisting of cameras and silencers are received and divided into servers that transmit notifications to farmers in case of abnormal individuals.The measurement device is installed inside the farm and measures the average, highest, and minimum values ​​of the body temperature and noise of chickens by set time units and then transmitted to the server.At this time, if the abnormalities are detected at the degree of body temperature or noise, the system is sent to the farm owner or farm manager immediately.The system was built.It is a system that compares and determines abnormalities, and is differentiated from existing products.In other words, chickens are determined by comparing the pre -measured normal values ​​with the normal measured normal values ​​with the time -specific time unit, considering the fact that the body temperature and noise change for 24 hours and the deviation of this change form a constant pattern.It was also developed as a user login using the PC's WEB system and mobile APP to search the farm real -time data and to easily search for measurement history and alarm history statistics.'High -pathogenic avian influenza and online education program development for foot -and -mouth disease blocking' were completed.The program is produced so that livestock workers, including farmers, can choose and learn only the desired parts anytime and anywhere on mobile devices such as PCs or smartphones.Anyone can access the Kedupam site and learn after applying for free. The program is currently being developed and serviced by two courses.The first process, 'High pathogenic avian influenza early detection and blocking prevention' course, is a total of 120 minutes of learning, 'Success and failure of blocking', 'initial symptoms and similar diseases', and 'high pathogenic avian influenza'The damage and danger, the actions and penalties for the discovery of suspicion, the selection of bird influenza disinfectant and disinfection, and the method of blocking wildlife and rodents.Blocking and vaccination process is about 100 minutes of learning, 'Features of the occurrence and symptoms', 'foot -and -mouth disease inflow factors', 'disinfectant selection and defense', 'vaccination and antibody verification'It is composed of the reporting method and related regulations.It is possible to actively utilize its own infectious disease blocking prevention education, ”he said.Considering the high proportion of workers, the company is also being translated into English in English in addition to Korean.It is expected to be helpful for the training of livestock farmers by producing and servicing subtitles in various countries such as Nepal, Vietnam, and Cambodian.
