- Vivo imitation and fully camouflage in visible light and infrared bands
- Pixelization and various colors implementation, anticipated contribution to the defense industry

When wearing gastrointestinal electronic skin, the color changes depending on the external environment during the day, so that the enemy is not exposed to the enemy, and can be disguised by adjusting the temperature of the electronic skin to adapt to the external temperature at night.

Seoul National University of Technology Professor Seung -hwan Ko developed a technology reminiscent of a transparent suit that was mainly seen in SF films such as 'Gong -dong'.It announced on the 10th that it has developed possible electronic skin.This element can be attached to the skin and the color or temperature is adjusted with an electricity signal to adapt to the external environment of the day or night, helping the eye or infrared cameras of the human eye or infrared camera.It is disguised as a proper disguise to increase the chance of survival by running away from predators or deceiving prey.Examples such as squid or octopus are examples.The nanometer -unit pigment particles of the head of the head can be rearranged by the distance between the pigment particles according to the needs, reflecting the light of visible light or infrared wavelength, and completely disguised in the external environment.Pay attention.Currently, there are many studies on camouflage or stealth technology that prevents enemies in the defense industry, but the commonly known commercial camouflage technology is universal fiber in the camouflage pattern that enters military uniforms.However, Camouflage pattern fibers are unable to actively camouflage, so it is easy to see when moving or in a complex pattern.The temperature was adjusted to the environment so that it could disguise the thermal imaging camera in the infrared band.In addition, the thermochromic liquid crystal ink, which is freely discolored according to the temperature, is applied to the flexible thermoelectric device so that the device can implement various colors.It refers to a device that can be absorbed or heated according to the thermoelectric element.It is heated.In the opposite direction of the current, the cooling/heating surface changes.In other words, the cooling/heating can be micro -adjusted according to the current direction and the voltage size, which is the principle of Pelty, which allows the research team to disguise the surface temperature and color of the thermoelectric element freely to disguise it from the visible light to the infrared band.It means that it can be disguised regardless of the day and night, and the researchers have not only been able to “pix” the surface of the gastrointestinal electronic skin, allowing only a few pixels to heat and cool.Therefore, even independently, even if it drives the thermoelectric pixels and delivers information like a display or moves in a complex pattern, it has produced devices that can be used in real time in real time.The researchers demonstrated directly by attaching gastrointestinal electronic skin to the skin, and confirmed that the disguise of the day and night and surrounding temperatures or complex bush environments as shown in the picture above.He said, “It is a very important factor in military and military that increases the survival rate of allies by not being caught by the enemy.I expect to contribute directly to our defense industry through this study. ”The findings have attracted great attention from the world, and on July 14, this year, 'Thermally Controlled,' 'Thermally Controlled,' in the top journal in the material science field.Active Imperceptible Arti ﬁ Cial Skin in Visible-to-Infrared Range.
