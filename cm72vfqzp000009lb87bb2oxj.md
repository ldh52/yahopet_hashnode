Exhibition topics and summary

Direction and space configuration plan

In the white cube: in the gallery exhibition space (m²), the flat -color surface of the hanbok is recognized as one pixel (50 × 50 mm) and forms an organic visual abstract conversation of mosaic configuration while forming a combination of horizontal/vertical.

Black Box: 'Alley Road (length M)' The color surface in front of the dark road is the time and place of time and place lyric (like twilight) and 'light (m²)' that passes through the road.Exhibit the visual abstract conversation that observed.(Light is a space that means that it means wealth, that is, the meaning of the artist's many observations.)

Reproduction of Time Representation of Time: Han+Bok

It is based on the application of the observed formators and colors based on Korean cultural customs, and is a colored painting that is visual abstraction of points, lines, places and colors observed in traditional clothing.The artist's exploration of Korean sex is a journey that is a journey to Korean minimalism in the visual area, and creates each consensus with the fundamental reason for the Korean formative formation.

Balanced Proportion of Time: Color Composition does not just mean physical time in my color, but also expresses the existence of 'existence' and 'state of feeling', and expresses the space to color.am.In other words, not only visual expression of any object, but also a reason for identifying the essence, not meaninglessness, but a decision of the journey that finds the fundamental meaning.

My molding is based on the molding and colors observed from the Korean Cultural Practices (clothing), and creates a visual -oriented abstract -colored painting with the points, line, cotton and color observed in traditional clothing.These colors are sedimentation of a series of observations to extract Korean identity.It also has its own characteristics that can be shared with the Western visual tradition.This is a global cultural sharing pursued by Hyundai, and paradoxically, it has the meaning of de -globalization.

My flat surface is a tool for thinking about Korean sex and starts with a structure that stimulates vision through “vision”.These colors are not just to pursue my expressions or artistic amusement indulgence that relate to meaning only with the formative composition.In other words, it is not a nihilistic “visual pleasure” that excludes other senses and pursues only visual pleasure.

The division of the screen, the subtle differences, and the extreme contrast were included in the exploration time to find the depth of Korean beauty, and the visual abstract painting through semantic interpretation and meaning generation.The application of paint (color) forms relationships from each memory stored in potential rituals-tradition, place, climate, status, purpose, and situation, and completes the reason for grasping the essence.

In the horizontal 50 × 50 (mm) plane, the divided places along the line (straight and keen curves) were divided into the structure of the traditional hanbok into grid and extracted through 'division and proportional'.The divided places are coordinated with colors, and each color surface creates a variety of arrangement combinations.These colors are divided into debris and are mosaics of diversity and color surfaces through 'set and distributed'.This process attracted the “journey of thought” of “Korean sex” as a visual area.

Color surface

The color surface is a reproduction of the time inherent in the meaning of consensus through the artist's observation of the elements inherent in the tradition (color, form.By converting traditional and customary meanings into a hypothetical meaning, making a collage of color on the square plane, especially the texture on the surface shows an optical phenomenon that is transmitted to a different feeling depending on the light, and according to the size and configuration of the combined color surfaceEven the sense and space come to mind.

Visual sculpture+space

It starts with a square plane, but the split, proportional, and color are formed with optical balance, expanding the tension and painting effects between the two and three dimensions to the interrelation.Plane space, harmony, flat space, convergence, and movement in the plane spaces will finally expand the scalability that explores three -dimensional communication opportunities in the space.

(Interesting) Observation+Expansion

My visual surface molding exposes the primary view of the plane, following, looking and expressing interesting formatures with observations that "simply implies the maximum meaning."This is a form of art and expressed in the form of art.In other words, the changes in time, habits, and memory and the times are composed of fragments in plane, and the mosaic that can give visual pleasure, and its physical scalability is infinite.

Balanced Proportion of Time: color composition

My color surface is a plane (2D) divided into geometric proportions.These plans are totally focused on visuals as 2D, like the Middle Ages or the Renaissance painter.But the color surface is extended to vision and space.This also means the process of progressing in different senses from visual center.In addition, these colors are a tool of communication, and each color side tries to convey meaning through different sensory ratios.In other words, daily mechanisms such as time, physicality, place, temperature, and climate.However, primarily, it is entirely focused on visuals, making the image recognized sensually.

Sympathy

The stuff and separation of the objects included in the space of the color surface were expressed as visually reconstructed at the same time.The perspective does not apply, but overlaps the elements in the space.The depth of these colors is an expression of each consensus formed through the sympathy containing both tactile, hearing, and olfactory, including vision.

In memory .. Now and the present

Some colors are metaphorically captured with magnificent spaces in memory - magnificent spaces, desolate spaces, sad spaces, depressed and ideal spaces.It contains the traces of remembered, changes, and port composition.In other words, this 2D is a color that contains my thoughts, and in line with the time and space of meaning.It reminds of time (nature, birth, survival, death, spring, summer, autumn, night, night, dawn, sea evening, etc.).

Time

All the arguments/materials in the world, which forms the color surface of this color composition, have been accumulated for a long time through my perspective and thinking (nature expresses their age and time visually in any way)It provides an experience that perceives purity) and a crystal created through chemical bonds (artist's consciousness area).

continuity

The colors are not separated from my time travel, but my abstract language with inseparable continuity formed in my life with me.These colors are relevant to my consciousness.Thus, these colors will go beyond the visual and areas and form a story and finally face spatial experiences.In other words, the events that occur in our daily lives (traveling, bruising, hiking, walking, walking, reading, sleep, etc.).Experience in enemy, formative, spatial, and physical properties) and heteropia experience.

So my color was a journey to reveal my heart in time and progress and to recognize and search my finiteness.The essence of search was the process of realizing that it was destroyed in my time, not to make it remember through color, but to express the memory itself.

In my color, ‘memory’ is not just a physical time, but also an expression of a space that exists 'existence of things' and 'state of feeling'.In other words, it was not a visual expression of the primary feeling of any object, but a journey that had a fundamental meaning, not meaningless and coincidence as a reason to understand the essence.

'The existence of human beings is with the progress of time and finite.'
