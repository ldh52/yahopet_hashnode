- Expectation of the government's active role to help animal rights groups, corporations, and private shelters

Recently, the prosecution was accused of euthanasizing about 200 animals rescued by Park So -yeon, CEO of Animal Rights Group Care, and Park's controversy over euthanasia began with internal accusations.Care was an animal protection organization that was adopted by President Moon Jae -in to President Moon Jae -in, and actively rescued the abused dogs and organic dogs, so Care's work, which has been promoted as a 'euthanasia shelter', is shocked by many people.It gave me.

Looking at the controversy of Care's euthanasia, the reporter's head comes to mind.The word power and posture was the time when the reporter served in the military.With the determination of 'Fight Tonight', the power and posture were required by the soldiers to fight and win even if there was a war this evening.

The abilities are possible when they have the ability to solve something and all elements.If you ask middle school students to take the SAT, it would be impossible for the middle school students.Middle school students have no (academic) ability to see college admissions.

Posture refers to a state of preparation to do something.For example, in contrast to the previous example, let's assume that a college student takes a middle school exam.The college student will have enough ability to solve the problem of middle school.However, if the college student is too much for excessive drinking the day before the exam, he can't go to the test site, but the college student has the ability, but he is not posted.

'Fight Tonight' must be equipped with both abilities and posture to win today.If you have only one of them, you can't win the war, and if you don't have it both, it's clear that you will be a hundred paulownia.

In order to win the war, you must have both abilities and postures.

Care's Park Dae -pyo explained to the euthanasia that "inevitably lived a small number of animals," and "the agreement was held in an animal hospital with all the people who participated in the meeting."On the other hand, it is wrong that Park lied, but he says that euthanasia is inevitable.'Because there are too many animals that need rescue, it is inevitable.'

Care Park So -yeon's euthanasia controversy, and three stations (Care, Animal Rescue Management Association, Private Shelter) will examine the controversy.

Yesterday, the reporter was able to meet Kim Chul -hoon, chairman of the Korea Animal Rescue Management Association (hereinafter referred to as 'Dong -gu Cooperative').Personally, I did not know about care for the Korea Animal Rescue Management Association.Care first heard the news when President Moon Jae -in adopted Tori, and first learned about the Eastern Cooperatives yesterday.

Chairman Kim Chul -hoon

In the controversy of euthanasia, Dong -gu Cooperative was discussed when Park So -yeon of Care mentioned the internal accuser ('The accuser was an employee of the Dong -gu Cooperative who had been killed').I visited the Seoul Organic Animal Adoption Center to meet with Kim Chul -hoon, chairman of Dong -gu.I heard about Donggu Cooperative through Kim.

The following is a summary of the introduction of Dong -gu Cooperative from Kim.

Animal Rescue Management Association

Unlike Care, which has been promoted as a "euthanasisless shelter," Donggu Cooperative is a corporation that implements euthanasia according to the guidelines.

The basic rules of the Eastern Cooperative are 'right to be protected by human beings', 'right to lean on human shoulders', 'right to enjoy painless life', and 'right to be free'.Although euthanasia is being implemented, the Dong -gu Cooperative is thoroughly observing this basic rules.

The Donggu Cooperative does not forget the rights of organic dogs in the animal shelter.The right to be protected by human beings, the right to lean on shoulders, the right to suffer, and the right to be free.

Among them, I had a long conversation with Kim for the right to live a painless life.He talked about the fact that he would be euthanized after at least one month after the statutory announcement, to be euthanized by a resident veterinarian, and that the carcass was treated as a normal procedure according to the law.

The value pursued by the Dong -gu Cooperative was found through the operating rules on the homepage.

The Dong -gu Cooperative provides the best residence environment to organic dogs, and all administration is disclosed.Along with the explanation of the Dong -gu Cooperative, Kim says, "It is not right that Care's Park's Park said.

At first, I felt sorry for the controversy of Ahn Lansa's controversy, and at first I felt sorry as a companion.Some people are angry about the lies of Park, and others say that they must correct the past and the present situation that Park had to do so.

For the two views, I don't want to cover the bibi who is right and wrong.But one thing is unfortunate about care that did not have the ability in light of the 'ability and posture' thrown at the beginning of this article.

Care is a group that is better than a group to rescue organic dogs.

Not only Park's representative, but also the employees of Care would have been passionate about the organic dog structure.But care did not have the ability.It was not equipped with space and conditions to accommodate organic dogs, but it was rescued over this.It was posted, but it was not capable.

Did you have the ability in light of 'ability and posture'?

People would have expected to be honest with care that care was not able to manage and accept organic dogs.But care was not honest in that point.That is hurt by those who love care.

Turn your eyes and look at the Donggu Cooperative.

The Dong -gu Cooperative implements euthanasia according to the guidelines.The best care is until the moment the organic dog lives.And let the organic dog finish their lives without pain.The Donggu Cooperative is implementing the 'euthanasia' that is not welcomed by anyone.No one welcomes euthanasia.The same is true of the Donggu Cooperative.

The Dong -gu Cooperative is commissioned and protected by 26 organic animals from 26 local governments.And the Dong -gu Cooperative implements euthanasia.At this time, this may be the only way to have the 'ability and posture' of organic animal protection.

If the Eastern Cooperative does not implement euthanasia, it may be the most desirable, but the Dong -gu Cooperative will lose its ability to accept organic animals.No matter how much you are poisoned, if you don't have the ability, this will be called bluff.

Think about the 'private shelter' on the protection of organic animals.

The reporter has never been active for animal rights.I have volunteered for organic animal shelter three times, and my neighbors have left the organic dogs on the road and have been appointed for a day.Therefore, even if you can say what you did well with the organic animal rescue activity of animal rights group care and the euthanasia of the Dong -gu Cooperative, you can't talk about it.

Let's think about the 'private shelter'

Among the animal shelters we have seen, the environment was commissioned and operated by local governments.However, the place where it was operated as an editorial was difficult in financial terms.

In the case of private shelters, most of them are operated mainly on donations.Due to the lack of treatment and feed costs, Dong -dong is often encountered through a cafe or band, and it is a pity to see it.Private shelter managers are not easy to get through the difficult reality because they are accepting organic dogs beyond the capacity of shelter.Like Care, private shelters are also posted, but they are unfortunate that they are not capable.

Care Park So -yeon's euthanasia controversy was examined from the standpoint of Care, Dong -gu Cooperative and Private Shelter.Care and private shelters have a posture, but they lack capacity, and the Dong -gu Cooperatives have abilities and posture, but unfortunately they do not get a positive response to 'euthanasia'.

So how are the animal rights organizations, corporations, and private shelters with 'abilities and posture' and get a positive reaction to everyone?

Can a healthy young man helped the kid who is struggling because of lack of ability?Yes, the healthy young man can help.And the controversy over the euthanasia of Care Park So -yeon, and many people who are sorry are looking forward to the role of the healthy youth.

The state should play the role of a healthy young man.

The number of organic dogs is increasing year by year, and the ability of the organizations to rescue them has reached its limit, and the unfortunate private shelter manager who wants to prevent euthanasia is experiencing financial difficulties.Because of the lack of finances, the right management is not being properly managed.A group that implements euthanasia according to the guidelines is silently doing his work without speaking a big voice.

The fundamental solution to this problem that everyone has is to ensure that organic dogs do not occur.Recently, pet government departments have released a report of parenting surveys.It is quite encouraging.We support the government's efforts to know the current status of domestic pets.It is expected that these efforts of the government will be advanced and will be achieved in the protection of organic animals.

We hope that the cases of developed countries in overseas pets, such as Germany without euthanasia, will be benchmarked, not only the voices of animal rights groups that emphasized organic animal structure, but also the opinions of private shelters and the positions of corporations that comply with guidelines.

The Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs is said to focus on private shelters nationwide.Through the government's parenting report, private shelter diagnosis, and overseas benchmarking, the government led the government to actively guide and support each organization to have 'ability and posture' for 'protection of organic animals'..
