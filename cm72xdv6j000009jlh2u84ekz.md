Sanbuk -myeon (Park Se -yoon) presented flower pots, which are plants, to resolve depression and defense, to 40 households living alone in the building, which feels more social isolation and depression due to the 19 -long change of Corona.

This pet plant support was more response by combining flower pots and horticulture therapy therapy, and supporting kits for planting plants directly, and more response.I attached a sticker to be able to call you at any time when you need help.

Park Mo, an age of 78, said, “Thank you very much for delivering pretty flower pots in the time I spend the same time as these days.” “It is comforting to see the flowers.”

Park Se -yoon, the director of Sanbuk -myeon, said, “I hope that pet plants will be the second gift after this spring, and I hope that seniors will be a small joy in the same difficult time these days.”I thanked the volunteer.
