The Gyeongsangbuk -do Bonghwa Education Support Agency (Park Se -rak) visits Bonghwa High School, Korea Forest Science High School, and Korea Pet High School on November 23rd (Mon) to encourage candidates ahead of the '2021 College Scholastic Ability Test'.I did it.

The event was designed to deliver the message of support and small gifts to high school high school students in Bonghwa Hall, and to encourage teachers who have been teaching hard.

Park Se -rak, the training center, supports the high school students who are preparing for the SAT test in the difficult situation of Corona 19, and the students who have lived hard to achieve their dreams are comfortable to control their health and condition until the day of the SAT test.I hope it will be time to do its best with a stable heart.
