Based on modern metal crafts, wood crafts, and lacquer crafts, the brush is reinterpreted in various ways to maximize the variation of the brush.In different formative languages ​​of craftsmen, different interpretations, such as direct approaches and variations of brush forms, and new approaches to the meaning of brushes, enrich the exhibition of the "brush of craftsmen."

The brush conveys thoughts and minds through writing.The world that cannot be expressed in writing is embodied in a picture and acts as an important object of communication.Crafts make things by hand and deliver their emotions.As with brushes, the hand is an important medium for conveying emotions in crafts.This value is revealed by causing empathy and forming a sense of assessment through the experience of people who use crafts.

Using a brush to paint and make crafts by hand.All of this is a process for beauty through slowness.A lot of strokes gather together to complete a picture, and when you see a crafts that are made through a long work process, the beauty of slow moving teasing leaves the afterglow of emotion.We pursue new beauty by adding the reason and emotion of craftsmen to the unstoppable charm that comes from the tip of the brush.
