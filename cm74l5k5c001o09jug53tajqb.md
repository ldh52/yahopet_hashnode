The Acris Animal Medical Center is a veterinary clinic in Seoul, which is a veterinary clinic that can be treated with stream cells and iggottic animal treatment.

I met with the Acris Animal Medical Center and the Acris Animal Medical Center Park Cheon -sik, founded in 1991, and heard about the center.

Park Won -jang, who is also the vice chairman of the cat's social society (as of 18), is well -known for the treatment of Igzotic animal such as raccoon, hedgehog, and rabbit, and recently, he is also treating regeneration using stem cells.
