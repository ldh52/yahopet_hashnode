Osan Early Birds Pet Care and Program are the education of high school students who are interested in pet animals to explore early Jin -ro.Students were able to see the pet culture that they had never been able to see well through the pet fair and dog show tour.In the first semester class, these events and class schedules were different, so I couldn't visit, but in the second semester, two events were held at the same time.

Students who have visited the pet industry and the dog show ... I would have seen and felt a lot through the tour, and I think that in the future class, I can easily understand pet culture, care elements, and social issues related to pets based on these experiences..
