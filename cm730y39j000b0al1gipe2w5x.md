The Gwangyang Institute of Education, Jeollanam -do (Director coordinator) held 'ECO Experience Learning' every Saturday and Sunday from October 30 to November 8, and 99 students were familiar with natural ecosystems.

Through this time, students had meaningful experiences such as bird ecology and microplankton observation.

In 2020, it was a year when most of the experience activities were canceled or reduced, with Corona 19, which amplified the regret and thirst for experiential learning.Students who participated in the program could solve the thirst that had accumulated due to the lack of outdoor experience activities.

Experiences were organized on five topics, including animal behavioral ecology, amphibian theory, environmental ecology, aqueous biology, and plant classification.

This ECO experience activity is meaningful in that it has caused interest and interest in natural observation for Kwang Young -young students, and confirmed the mystery of the natural environment around us through various ecosystems.

Song Ji -ye, a student of Yonggangjung, who participated in the activity, said, “It was a pity and disappointing that this year's experiential learning was canceled.Jung Eun -eun said, “I found out that there were a lot of plants that I did not know around us, and the various birds observed through the telescope were so amazing and special.”
