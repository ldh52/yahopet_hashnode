For the first time in Korea, Andongho floating on the water is floating on the background of a beautiful forest with a beautiful forest with a blue autumn sky and autumn leaves at 10 am on the 6th.It is held on artificial islands.

The concert began with a concert of cello, violin, and trumpet, and Andong-si and K-water Kwon Kwon (K-Water) Andong Kwon (K-WAR) were designed to protect the habitat of the iron gulls and strengthen the citizens' solidarity of environmental protection.

The iron gull is called a little tern by attaching iron that is the smallest of the type of seagull.

From April to July, he breeds in Korea, Japan, and China, and moves to Australia and the Philippines between August and September.

Because of the habits of nesting in the sandy sandy fields, the bird is very vulnerable to environmental changes and natural enemies.

Although it is designated as an endangered species rating, such as Japan, Australia, and Europe, Korea is currently conducting a full survey to designate endangered crisis rating.

The largest habitat for domestic iron gulls was the Nakdong River Estuary, including Busan Eulsukdo and Shinja, but it was disappeared by the construction project near the coast, the loss of white sand beach, and the invasion of natural enemies.

The twin sand islands are known as 'Andong Innisfree', which is the island in the lake that created a new life, and is also called 'Andong Ho's ideology' as the south of Jeju Island because it appears and disappears.

However, as the habitat was submerged due to the rise of the Andongho level, Andong City was temporarily established in March last year to create a safe habitat, and this year, a permanent artificial sand island was installed.

Instead of the existing sand island, which sank 10 meters below the surface of the sleep, it also created a hideout that could float 50 meters wide and 20 meters long, covered Masato on it, and then avoided natural enemies such as owls.

The creation of artificial sand wasland was successful.Luckily, Idong -si and Water Resources Corporation succeeded in laying eggs and raising their babies on the artificial island where Andong -si and Water Resources Corporation had strengthened.I left.

These birds, which lost their homes because of man, are now looking for nest with the help of man.

Andong -si expects to act as “Park” in Heungbujeon, and plans to expand the existing habitats in the future and promote ecotourism resources in connection with the upstream of the Nakdong River, including Dosan Seowon.

Kwon Young -se Andong Mayor said, “I hope that it will be a little comforting to the people who are tired of corona through this concert and the scenery around the lake at Andong -ho, which shows the possibility that birds and people coexist together.”.

The concert is expected to be impressed by the unique concerts such as the Chamber Orchestra, the cello, the violin and the trumpet.
