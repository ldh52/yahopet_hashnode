Emily Doran has been an English instructor for 10 years in Korea and has adopted more than 170 dogs to the United States!

Last Saturday, I met with Emily Doran, who visited the Animal Structural Management Association to adopt organic dogs.Emily, who has lived in Korea for more than a decade, is said to leave for Vietnam two weeks later.

Emily, who adopted 130 of the 170 dogs from the Animal Rescue Management Association and sent overseas to the United States, were dogs ahead of euthanasia after the announcement period.

After going to Vietnam, when her story was told through Emily and SNS, which would continue to adopt to the United States through a domestic network, there was a comment and support for 'Thank you for doing what we did.'
