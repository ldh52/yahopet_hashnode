There is no staircase as a staircase on the device with a stable and up and down where the height is different.But the height of the stairs that are matched to people can be burdensome for some small children.

And most of the stairs are made of slippery materials, so they often burden the children's patella.

​

In addition to stairs, beds, sofas, and chairs made by human ergonomically matched can be a bit difficult for our children.

​

The best form for our pets is slide, not stairs.This is because in nature, the ramp is moved rather than an artificial staircase.Such a ramp is not overwhelming regardless of the size of the pet.

To solve this problem, you need a staircase for pets.There are two types of requirements.

The first is the height of the stairs,

The second is the material of the stairs.

​

The height of the stairs is not recommended to exceed the length of the pet legs.The best thing is the gentle ramp form.

​

Second, the material is made of only the end of the staircase in the case of the staircase used by a person.But our children use not only the end of the stairs, but also the middle and back parts.Therefore, it should be a material that is not slippery as a whole.

It is a staircase common in houses, but it can be a dangerous structure for our children.A safe passage must be guaranteed.
