"Please make a venture! Please make it investment!"

The most requests to hear from the people I meet are, “Make a venture!Let me get investment! ”It's a story.Why do you want to create a venture company?What benefits do you want to be a venture?

If you become a venture company, you can get a lot of benefits.The biggest is corporate tax, 50% reduction in income tax, 75% of acquisition tax, 50% reduction in property tax, etc.So, many startups and young entrepreneurs want to venture.

However, in order to be a venture, you need to have a variety of conditions.To be a venture, you must basically approach four venture types.Venture investment companies, R & D companies, technology evaluation guarantees, preliminary venture companies>.Basically, except for preliminary venture companies, research expenses should be spent at a certain amount (more than 50 million won), patents, and technical evaluation of patents.Somewhat convenient for these conditions is to receive more than 5,000 won in investment from Venture Investors: Professional Angel Investors or Individual Investment Associations.

By the way, who will invest 50 million won for a beginner company that has no sales and has only a business plan?Or, with a specific patent, you have to go to the Sinbo or Kibo and get a loan of more than 50 million won, which is all in debt.It is the money you have to pay back.It takes less than a year to spend 50 million won, but it takes a few years to buy.

Many early companies want to invest.Receiving investment means selling your stake to investors.However, initial investors are trying to receive investments without giving their shares.It is a fire.

In order to receive investments, you need to give a picture that will be invested.Be prepared.Each year, the government will solve policy funds to companies that are doing small businesses, startups, ventures, SMEs, and re -start -ups.However, in order to receive the funds, you must have the basic conditions to have basically.

Nowadays, the conditions are getting better, so the prospective founders are also founded as founders.You can start a business after receiving policy funds.However, people who have applied for policy funds once know.How much do I have to have to fill in policy funds?Basically, the following conditions must be equipped to pass the first document screening to some extent.

It takes almost one year to secure the brand, the logo, especially the patent, which the company should prepare first.So you have to start a prepared start -up.You should be prepared a year before you set up a company.So you need to check and make a plan in advance of the following matters.The following is based on corporate companies.

1) You should make a decision on whether or not to be a corporate company or <individual company>.

In order to be invested early and to create a large company in the long run, it is indispensable to establish a corporation.

2) As a representative of the Corporate Company, it is a good idea to establish a company as a one -person representative in the early days to secure a 100%stake.

The early co -representative is good, but in the end it creates a big problem.It is advisable to prepare a company system for personnel and funds with long -term goals.

3) If you can do it, take <Investment> in the early days of business.Loan from government agencies is not too late afterwards.

Receive Investment to create a Venture, and make an investment in the future.Initially, the wrong investment is a major condition for attracting further attractions and drawing big pictures.

4) A year before you create a company, prepare for your goals, mutual name, trademarks, and patents, and create conditions for the government's funding and investments.

Is it difficult?Then don't start business.The business is not a school club meeting.

5) Meet the right mentor.

Meet Mentor or Consultant, who knows how to present the whole plan.While dragging the business, I sometimes met a consultant.All the consultants I met gave a guide to Gun by Kun.

However, what the company's representative wants is a long -term plan.

It is a long -term fund plan, system operation plan, and time plan.And don't come before the Consulting Costs for them.Why do you come to the lawyer or the company's money?This is because consultants do not provide proper information to their customers.To get valuable information, provide that value.

6) Write a detailed <Business Plan>.Create a three to five -year business plan.

Create a delicate business plan based on 5m (man, machine, material, money, management).Even if it is not done, the company eventually goes there.

7) The personality of the company and externally entering the company is <Investment, Loan, and Loan.We need to calculate the necessary funds for the current company and the future, and make a plan for it.

A lot of money is built up in -house, so the business is not necessarily successful.When it's a venture, it's a bit hungry.

To do business, prepare at least a year ago.
