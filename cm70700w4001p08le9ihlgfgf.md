Esteemed photographer, Randal Ford, will be onsite to discuss the featured artwork and his process behind capturing puppy smiles.

"Each portrait is a window into the puppy's world, their unique quirks and personality. Puppies smile in a lot of different ways, but I was lucky enough to catch a few that showed off their healthy puppy teeth," said Ford. "I'm excited to be partnering with DentaLife to celebrate all the joy puppies bring to our lives."

DentaLife Puppy Teething Chews safely redirect chewing behavior during peak teething age, when puppies' adult teeth emerge. The chews are formulated by Purina pet care experts for puppies at least three months old, and contain DHA, EPA and calcium to support healthy brain, tooth and bone development.

"By the age of three, most dogs develop some form of dental disease. To ensure their well-being, it's essential to establish a healthy dental routine at an early age," said Harris. "DentaLife Puppy Teething Chews can help this process by supporting puppies' natural drive to chew."

By celebrating puppies through art, the Puppy Smiles Gallery by DentaLife hopes to inspire people to create a healthy dental routine to set their pup up for dental health success as they continue to grow.
