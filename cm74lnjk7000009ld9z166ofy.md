While watching the competition, I was able to meet with the representative of the Korea Border Collie Rescue Association, who talked with Korean Hoseo students.

Kwon, the representative of Kwon, who introduced himself as an early member of Korea's first word in Korea, and four dogs who donated to the Korean Hoseo pet from the Bordercoli Rescue Association, were in the game.I was able to hear a lot of stories about Eosility.

“The cause of organic dogs is that they are easily adopted and do not understand their dogs while living together.It is a way to prevent organic dogs from interacting with dogs and understanding dogs through poison sports such as Earth. ”

After the economy was completed, the awards ceremony was held, and the winners of each event were given a listing and product.During the vacation, Korean Hoseo Pet students who attended the competition also achieved good results.Kwon, who has watched this, says, “The students who love pets more than anyone else, and are the leaders who will lead the domestic pet culture soon.”

“If you can interact with your companion, you can do any dog, regardless of the breed, and I hope that the Earthsis is activated, so I hope many companions will be together.”Kwon says the rescue association.

The Earthrance Club Tournament held in Good Friend, Namyangju, the game and awards ceremony began until 5 pm.My first attendance of the Earth Club Competition…It is a 'exciting toxport sports yard that is enjoyed by companions and Eosility enthusiasts.'

If you listen to outdoor activities that your dog and companion can do together, there's not much to say.No, the degree of walk with a dog may be all.In recent years, problems such as dogs, such as dogs, will be conscious of the stingy eyes of non -rebellious people.However, there is nothing to do if you visit a dog cafe or playground.There is nothing different except to visit to cultivate the sociality of dogs.

However, if you do poison sports with your dog, the activities and actions that your companions and dogs can do will be much more and wider.A dog that moves and reacts to the companion's signal…In that action and appearance, the companion will interact with the dog.

You can see that at the Good Friends Earth Club.Both companions and dogs are bright and full of energy.Handler and dog's dog running through the stadium.Indeed, they believe and rely on each other, play with all their strength, and enjoy the game itself.

There are no dog playgrounds around, but if you think about it, we don't have a place to do it, but it's not ready to enjoy it.

Kwon, a representative of the Korea Border Coli Rescue Association between 2003 and 2005, said that it is possible to educate Doksports by the Korea Border Collie Rescue Association.The population is increasing, but we are still unable to prepare a pet culture that suits it in proportion to the increase in the population.

Kwon says, “I can prevent the dog's dog by interacting with dogs and understanding dogs through poison sports.”I thought it was a poison sports that only the dogs who had been trained in professional training were, but today I learned today that the exercise that can be done with any dog ​​is a word of fear.

Doksports culture that can be shared with dogs

In foreign countries, Doksports culture with dogs, such as Earth and Frisbi, has developed in each region, and is said to be universal.

Shouldn't we develop our poison sports culture, now our companions and our culture.In Korea, the healthy and lively poisonous sports culture develops, and we want to be universal for everyone to enjoy and participate.
