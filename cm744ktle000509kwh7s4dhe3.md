It is a world that is hard to build a body, and there are people who practice extreme animal love for more than 10 years.Park Mi -ja (62) who lives in the budget group.

At 4 am, like a night, Park is snowing, wind, and leaving home at the same time every day.To take care of the cats and organic dogs living on the road.The number is 120 to 150 in the area of ​​Eungbong alone.

Did you say that the beasts who carefully cared for their lives came out of the world?Even in the dawn of the mother's award, Park reminded me of the deceased who cherished his life, pouring the feed and filling the water bowl.

“My mother said,“ Don't throw it off. ”He always said hello to eat deliciously.It was a lot of influence. ”

While speaking, his gaze is directed to cats who eat feed.The voice calling the name of a single name gathered by the side is warm and peaceful.

Park, who works as a nursing caregiver, starts working at 5 am.It would not be easy to give rice once a day, but take three times.

“At dawn, I go around the area of ​​Gokgok -ri and Hwari, and come around 10:30 and give it one more time.The children coming by time are different.After 5 pm, I go home and go to Song Seok -ri's house.There are 50 to 60 cats that take care of them. ”

I ask if it's hard.“If you think hungry children are waiting, you can't stay still.When you see it, you run through the jump, and when it rains, you sit under the eaves.Then I don't know it's hard.Rather, I feel energy and I feel alive ”

The costs such as feed costs and drug prices are not easy, but there are some people who add hearts around.It also sponsors a certain amount of money every month, and a convenience store collects lunch boxes that have been over the expiration date.The family is also his strong support forces.

The neighbors who watched Park, who had been living as “Cat Mom” for a long time, helped him and treated the animals on the road, but it wasn't from the beginning.

“The elderly in the neighborhood were crazy.Why don't you give me rice, so I don't want to twist.But because these guys go back and forth, they won't go in and out at home, and the mole of field crops won't go away.The perception has changed.Once I have been caring for more than six years, I have caught a snake trying to attack my grandmother.I didn't like to give rice, but please take care of it after that. ”

He conveys a cat's dancing story (?) With an excited voice.

Park, who has an organic dog, has many stories on his chest.The dog who was hurt by a man, a puppy who died, but eventually passed away..As he talks calmly, he finally shows tears.

“There are many lives on the way that needs help.Especially in winter, there are often cases where you can't eat water.I hope you will be a little more interested at the local government level so that you can spend safe life safely. ”

Suddenly, Park shines brightly on the bright morning sun.

“A monk is that.It is good for my eternal life if you care about one or two animals in your life.It is life to go when you live in one world.Wouldn't it be nice to live and care for it? ”
