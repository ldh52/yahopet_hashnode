In particular, the millennials in their 20s and 30s can be a decision that requires greater courage.

The author of Goesan Diary, published by Publisher CUCURRUCUCU, was born in Seoul and lived only in the city.Although there have been longing for rural life for a long time, it was difficult to leave the city while attending a company and working, like most young generations.

The author, who had been so busy, was diagnosed with a rare disease -related rare disease in Berlin, and then realized that it was time to stop everything and rest.And slowly, moderately and healthy, I started my life in Goesan.

Goesan Diary is a one -year record for the first rural life that the author missed and envyed so much.It is not a detailed book that introduces or struggles to introduce attractions.

It is close to a single phase collection of everyday life and the scenes that came to mind in Goesan and the scenes that came to mind.What is the landscape of the countryside viewed by the millennials?For those who are tired of Corona 19, the writings and paintings in Goesan Diary will be a small rest.

It was snowing enough to cover the lid of the jangdokdae.

When I saw a hat that seemed to have received a hat one by one, I felt the accumulation of time.

Normally, time seems to just flow long.

Then, after facing this moment, I think that time is actually accumulated.

Seeds are sprinkled on the ground, sprouting, flowers bloom, and fruit.

The leaves are leaves on the branches that were dry, the color changes and it dries up again.

It doesn't just go through meaninglessly, but it accumulates little by little and gradually changes.

If this is like this, many days have accumulated and I wonder what I'm going.

Daily trivial events.What is your emotions?
