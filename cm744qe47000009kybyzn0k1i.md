'Yeonam University' first comes to mind.Perhaps it was because I often encountered the news of the “round opening team” through the Yajoppet page.

On September 19 (Sat), I went to Yeonam University with students in Osan City Early Birds Program.

Get off at the front door and look around the school, and I noticed a signboard where you can look at the school at a glance.Yeonam University, where green natural scenery was unfolded, was enough to feel the fresh nature of nature.

I arrived at the seminar room with a guidance, where I was able to get an introduction to school and department.The introduction was conducted by Professor Ha Yoon -chul of Animal Protection, but after hearing the explanation of Professor Ha, I learned new facts that I didn't know before.

'Yeonam University has several departments like general schools, and the animal protection is one department.'I thought I had about the school before I was introduced.

“We are receiving less than 500 freshmen a year.Have you ever seen a new student in a year? ”Professor Ha's explanation contained many meanings.

And through Professor Ha's explanation, I learned that 'Yeonam University is a specialized school that fosters future agricultural and human resources.'The academy to cultivate further agricultural and livestock talent!It seems to be an expression that suits Yeonam University.

Unlike other university departments, which are often organized around dog training and dog beauty, Yeonam University has a different approach to pets.Professor Ha's explanation was able to hear words such as animal health and animal experiments at Yeonam University.

Yeonam University, which is essential to the subject of 'proud Yeonam -in', is said to be organized for the goal he chose.

After listening to Professor Ha Yoon -chul, I visited the school facilities according to the guidance.It was literally the largest facilities in Korea, such as a training ground for dogs, an indoor training ground, and an outdoor training ground.

After visiting the facility, I visited the demonstration of the dog training and basic obedience training conducted by Professor Lee Woong -jong.On this day, Professor Lee also demonstrated training on foot detections that track people or things along the footsteps of a person.

Yeonam University has a history of 40 years!

Yeonam University has grasped the core of new trends such as pets and smart farms and educated not only professional technologies but also cultural courses that should be held as a professional.The curriculum was organized so that students who were educated with solid theories and practice could be trained as talents who will carry the agricultural industry in the future.

Yeonam University, which has the largest strength in the animal health field, the trend of the pet industry and organized the curriculum to suit it, is specialized in the agricultural industry.

A tour of Yeonam University with Osan Early Birds Program students was a meaningful time to see the future of Korea's agricultural industry and pet animals that will be led by young people in Yeonam.
