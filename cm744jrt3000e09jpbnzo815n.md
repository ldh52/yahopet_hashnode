In particular, this year, overseas works were exhibited in 16 countries, more than 10 countries, and the number of works increased nine times compared to the previous year.The Busan Design Promotion Agency promoted an award to reliable international design groups such as the International Design Association (ICO-D) and the World Design Organization (WDO) to promote the overseas promotion of Busan International Design Awards, and SNS advertisements targeting 10 major cities abroad.As a result, a large number of overseas works were exhibited.A total of 37 overseas works, including three points, were honored.

In addition, since this year, the judges were recruited to secure fairness as an international design award, and have been recruited by designing professors and professors with more than 10 years of practical experience.The judges who passed the document screening selected the judges for each part through the lottery program.The system was established with a fair system from the entry to the screening of the work, and the event was completed without any objection.

The general division was selected by 'Bloomy: Universal Smart Watch', which was exhibited by Lee Jin -won, a student at Samsung Design Education.It is a universal design smart watch designed for people with deaf and other people who are difficult to talk.

In the student department, 'Doggy Talky', which was exhibited by Kim Na -eun, a student at St. Paul Seoul, won the Grand Prize.It is a healthcare band for pets, and it is a product that can check the health of pets in real time through the electrocardiogram sensor mounted inside the device.

The Busan International Design Award is also linked to the Asia Design Platform (ADP), which was established for the international design industry exchange and revitalization, beyond the limitations of the state and region.Database the award entries and winners, and allow companies and designers that need design to make the design concept not only works through the platform, but rather realized and commercialized.

In addition, consulting and subsidies will be provided to register intellectual property rights only for the winners, and patented works will be supported by design ideas in connection with the design market through the Asia Design platform.

The winner of the company will be able to use the Busan International Design Awards logo so that it can be used for commercialization even after the end of the award.
