Uljin -gun (Gunsu Jeon Chan -Gul) will complete the Uljin -gun Animal Protection Center, which is installed at the Uljin incinerator site in Goseong -ri, Uljin -eup, so that the organic dogs of poor environments can receive systematic and hygienic management in comfortable and comfortable protection facilities.

The completion of the animal protection center has been working for construction since 2019, but it is possible after the difficulties of changing the site several times, and consists of 365„é° of building area, outdoor playground, and silk.

Prior to the completion of the construction, 26 dogs were transferred to the Animal Protection Center on the 22nd, which was protected by a temporary shelter for the veterinary clinic, according to the improvement of the Beagle Rescue Network.

Recently, the claim that the organic dogs subject to euthanasia are being raised as a dog farm, which are argued by the bhikkhu -hyeop, have been found to be not true, and the opinions of the bhiku cooperative are expected to be actively reflected in the operation of the animal protection center.

Uljin -gun has an average of more than 500 organic dogs per year, and the trend is increasing every year, and the current consignment shelter is limited to organic animal management.It was put in place and started at the end of June.

In Uljin -gun, if the animal protection center is directly operated in earnest, it will do its best to make pets more happy to implement a happy Uljin -gun.
