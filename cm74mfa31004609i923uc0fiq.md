- Liberty Bell Celti's charm
- A place where you can meet various services such as veterinary hospitals, hotels, and beauty in one place

The dog cafe 'Liberty Bell' is located on the 2nd floor of the Royal Dog & Cat Medical Center in Gwangjin -gu, Seoul.'Liberty Bell' is a shortcut to the Shuttle Land Dog Dog, located in Onam -eup, Namyangju -si, Gyeonggi -do.Today I visited the Liberty Bell Dog Cafe in Gwangjin -gu.

When you enter the cafe, you will see a price tag, you will see cute props inside the rectangular cafe, and the entrance wall is introduced to Liberty Bell's resident dog.

It is a breed called 'Celti' as a shuttland velocity, and Celti is a sheep dog (a dog) who drove her sheep.Celti said, 'Smart and playful.Learn to learn and are smart, so if you train, follow them well.Celti has a very strong loyalty and obedience to the owner. '

When I visited a dog cafe elsewhere, I was able to meet Celti sometimes, compared to other breeds that came up on my knees and played, and Celti was not easy.

Today, I'm drinking a car in Liberty Bell, and a friend comes to the side gently.It is nice to see it, and I continue to do what I did without knowing it.

Stop the work of Celti's hospitality and look around.Looking at it, you can see a breed that is not easy to meet.As I looked at it, it is a breed called 'Chinese Crested'.I knew that the country of origin was Mexico, but when I searched, China and Africa were originally native.

I travel to a dog cafe all over the country and meet a breed that I can't meet as usual.

As I listened to the news of the animal abuse of Han Yu -bok (Korea Organic Biotympatical Welfare Association) and focused on writing, like Celti, this time, I couldn't play properly even though I was next to China.It is gentle and quietly approaching and sitting back home.

The veterinary clinic on the first floor can be descended through the stairs inside the cafe.The picture below shows the counter and the medical office of the Royal Dog & Cat Medical Center.

Liberty Bell Dog Cafe was synergistic with a veterinary clinic.It seems that guests who visit the hospital or visiting the Liberty Bell Dog Cafe can receive various services in one place.

There are three dog cafes in Seoul with the name of a domestic shuttland dog -to -dog dog called Liberty Bell.In addition, in connection with the dog cafe, the veterinary hospital is next to the veterinary clinic, providing convenience for the guests who visited Liberty Bell.

Liberty Bell Dog Cafe, where I met handsome Celti and met the Chinese Crested, which I could not usually meet!In the winter of February 2019, the snow is going to make beautiful memories in Liberty Bell.
