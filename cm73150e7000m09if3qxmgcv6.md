The Gyeongsangbuk -do Jamsa Insect Plant signed a joint research agreement (MOU) with the Holosse Ecological Conservation Research Institute (CEO Lee Kang -un) to develop endangered insects and biodiversity preservation proliferation technologies at the Holosse Ecological Conservation Research Center on the 16th.

Through the joint research agreement, the two organizations decided to actively cooperate with the study and advice of the endangered insect preservation and proliferation technology, insect biodiversity preservation and research, and the exchange and advice of academic and technical information.

Domestic endangered insects are gradually decreasing due to the destruction of habitats and overfishing, and the importance of biodiversity has increased according to the Nagoya Protocol*, and the need for preservation and restoration of biological resources is emerging.

*Nagoya Protocol: International Convention on the Fair and Equity of Fair and Equity of Profitors from Access to Genetic Resources of Biological Diversity Convention and the Use of Genetic Resources

By utilizing insect growth, restoration technology, manpower, and experimental facilities accumulated through this agreement, the two institutions are expected to create various synergy effects such as discovering joint research projects, educational, academic and public relations.

The Holosse Ecological Conservation Research Institute has been conducting insect habitats, preserving and environmental education, and research, starting with Holocse Ecological School in 1997. Various endangered crisis insects such as red point Mossabi, water generals, and baby horns.Is restoring proliferation.

At the Gyeongsangbuk -do Jamsa Insect Plant, in 2017, the Daegu Regional Environment Agency was approved for growth and restoration, and it succeeded in developing the indoor artificial proliferation technology of the endangered wildlife II, which is the endangered wildlife, and the proliferation of endangered endangered insects in the province.We are pursuing research.

Kim Wang -sik, the Jamsa Insect Plant, said, “The joint research agreement has laid the foundation for revitalizing the proliferation and restoration of various endangered insects.”We will continue our efforts to create a habitat environment in connection with the Insect Theme Ecological Center so that many people can approach them. ”
