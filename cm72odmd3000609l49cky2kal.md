- Based on the research service, analyze the genome of pets and apply when subscribing to pet insurance

Zen ID has signed a research service contract for the development of human genome -based ID systems using transparent OLED display technology with Yonsei University.

Zen ID (CEO Yoon Yoon -kyung) announced on the 10th that it has signed a research service contract for the development of human genome -based ID systems using transparent OLED display technology.

Zen ID will establish a pipeline to develop DNA sequence security certification technology through this research service.The abolition of a new security certificate of the National Assembly will establish a genetic information DB that can only be used as a biological signature when a new security certification means is needed, and by using identification factor analysis and encryption technology, it is fundamentally solving the integrity problem of certified certificates, IDs and PW methods.Goal.

Timin (T), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and adenine (A) of transparent OLEDs are the R (red), G (green), B (blue), W (white) of the transparent OLEDBy mixing colors, the chromatography method can be dramatically improved the password system of the previous ID and PW combination.

In addition, a total of 6GB of container type password chain structure can contain multiple credit cards, resident registration cards, SNS IDs, and passwords at the same time.

If the password is forgotten under the 256 -bit password system of the blockchain, the problem of not recovering the transaction history can be solved by combining the blockchain technology with the personal identity through the DNA security certification technology of the research service.

Jen ID is analyzing the genome of pets based on this research service and providing services such as providing pet insurance claims with DNA -based animal ID and providing genetic diseases, diseases, and learning ability information through genetic analysis.We plan to establish a system.

By using the IC chip memory space in the pet card, you can pioneer new business areas in the pet market by combining drug side effects, genetic diseases, and diseases with genetic information of the pet family.

Kim Ji -hyun, a professor of system biology at Yonsei University, who will carry out research services, is a genome expert who published a paper that studied genome evolution in 2009.In 2009, he won the Korean Biological Information System Biology Society, the 2018 Korean Microbiology Society Academic Awards, and the 2019 Korean Academic Award.

Zen ID plans to focus on creating a new K-Bio trend in the integrity genome-based ID business through this research agreement with Yonsei University.

Zen ID, a member of the Korea Bio Association, has obtained the ISO 9001 Quality Management System and the ISO 14001 Environmental Management System and has been selected as an IP narrative support operator organized by the Korea Intellectual Property Office.

Zen ID Overview

Zen ID is developing DNA marker -based personalized ID development projects on the “One ID for Platform” and the next -generation display device, the transparent OLED -based COLOR CODE ID.Based on this, the company is promoting the development of pet -only bio treatment through pet ID development for pet insurance and pet DNA analysis.The health business in combination with Bio has launched 'Moon Ji -sook Pilates and Bio Mats', which is famous for celebrity Pilates, and operates 'Museum YouTube', which treats DNA mental therapeutic programs with music platform 'Moon Ji -sook' and DNA mental therapy program.I do it.
