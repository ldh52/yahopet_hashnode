There is a dog cafe Odogi with a natural grass playground in Dongducheon.I have to explain it in a lot of words about Odok, but I don't know what to say.The word 'dog café can be like this' seems to be a great way to explain Odog.

Dog Cafe Outing searches for Dongducheon Dog Café and tells you that there is a dog cafe called Odog.There were several dog cafes in Dongducheon, the most noticeable of them.

Feeling more than expected!Introducing the video first.

... The wind is also headed to Dongducheon Dog Café.

The moment you arrive in Odog ... 'Wow!'I didn't even think that the dog cafe would look like this.

1st and 2nd floors, rooftops, and first basement floor…The cute props and neat interiors are very impressive.I'm returning to the first floor and drinking tea, and my companion dog and resident dogs who visited the dog cafe make me smile in my mouth.Among the guests' dogs, Mong -gu and Bong -gu turn on the laptop and comput the computer.

When I was drinking coffee and playing with cute dogs, the sun was over and night.More than 10 years ago, I passed through the road with Odog, and I felt that the scenery was good every time.When I came to Odok today, there is a playground for dogs in that good scenery.Odogok's appearance in combination with beautiful nature.Personally, I want to call it a hidden gem of Dongducheon.

Dongducheon's hidden gem was deep at the night
