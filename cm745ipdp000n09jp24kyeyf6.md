For the first time in Korea, a pet bookstore was created in the veterinary clinic.It is the walking animal hospital in Jeonju.What is the way to make a healthy animal coming to the hospital?

Perhaps there are many ways, but I think the pet bookstore is a quirky way.Everyone thinks, but a pet bookstore that could not have been practiced.This is the Jeonju Walk Animal Hospital.

The pet bookstore in the veterinary clinic, which was directly visible, was filled with pet books.There were books that I read, some books were listened to the title, and some books I saw for the first time.

In addition to painful pets, you can visit the veterinary clinic with a healthy pet to look at the pet -related books.

Pets related books are on display

It is now expected that there will be a culture that will visit and purchase pets as well as feeds and goods at veterinary hospitals.Wouldn't it be common to see this figure in a local animal hospital for the first time in the animal hospital?
