Among the stories of Park Jong -moo's veterinarian, the stories of organic animals and urban animals could be an unknown topic, but Park showed an easy and fun explanation for the listener.

Park Jong -moo told his story as if he had become a veterinarian, when he was happy and difficult, and talked about the animals he lived together.

Someone tells my own story ... I had a conversation with many soldiers when I served in the military, but there were not many soldiers who opened their hearts and tells their stories.I don't tell you that you can't tell your story, which means you haven't overcome it yet.Doesn't it mean that someone tells someone who wants to hide it too, and that you overcome it?

Park Jong -moo, a veterinarian who told the story with his cat

Park Jong -moo, a veterinarian who tells the reason for becoming a veterinarian, had a personal pain because of the reason for choosing a veterinarian, but Park told the story in a comfortable atmosphere that seemed to talk to the uncle next door.

As a veterinarian, when I was happy and sad, and when I telled the pet story that I lived together, it felt as if I was listening to a calm essay.

The story of organic animals and urban animals ... It is not easy to explain this problem more easily.As I listened to the problems of organic animals and urban animals, which were considered difficult, and the veterinarian Park Jong -moo, I seemed to be able to understand the problem naturally.

Park Jong -moo talked about 'to live with animals'.It is often used to use the word 'coexistence', but Park Jong -moo used the term 'symbiosis'.

Explaining the case of India, we compared the eyes of Indians looking at the animals on the street and our Koreans.The appearance of India who recognizes the existence of each other and lives without harming each other.Park asks a question about what would happen if a pig appeared on the street?If this happens, both people and pigs are amazed and embarrassed.

Park Jong -moo said, â€œIt is depending on the perception of people looking at the animals, acknowledging and living with each other's differences.
