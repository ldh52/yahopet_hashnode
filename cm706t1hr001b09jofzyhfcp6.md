BARK (NYSE: BARK), a leading global omnichannel dog brand with a mission to make all dogs happy, has teamed up with real estate marketplace Zillow to determine the top 10 cities to find dog-friendly rentals in the United States.

BARK combined its thirteen years' worth of dog data, based on BarkBox and Super Chewer subscribers, with Zillow’s extensive database of pet-friendly rentals to identify the cities that are obsessed with dogs, as well as the dog names and breeds that residents will most likely call “neighbor.”

A few of the most interesting takeaways include:

- Even dog obsession is bigger in Texas: Dallas, Austin and San Antonio took the top three spots for most dog-obsessed cities.
- United States of Retrievers: Unsurprisingly, Golden Retrievers and Labrador Retrievers are among the most popular dog breeds in the top dog-friendly cities. Other popular breeds include American Pit Bull Terriers and Australian Shepherds.
- New Yorkers love the French (Bulldogs): In New York City, French Bulldogs are the most popular breed, and it's the only city to have French Bulldogs as the most popular breed.
- If you hear someone yell 'BEAR!' at a dog park, it might be a… DOG: Bear is the most popular name for dogs in cities such as Indianapolis, Phoenix and Jacksonville.

"At BARK, we embrace that dogs are part of the family, and finding a home or apartment that is dog-friendly is at the top of dog people’s minds," said Dave Stangle, VP of Brand Marketing at BARK. "We teamed up with Zillow to show dog parents the most dog-obsessed cities in the country, and where they can find rentals that are rolling out the welcome mat (and toys) for dogs."

"The number of dog parents in the U.S. skyrocketed during the pandemic as people shifted to working from home, which really spotlighted the need for dog-friendly rentals," said Emily McDonald, Zillow’s rental trends expert. "In collaboration with BARK, we've pinpointed cities that are particularly welcoming to dogs. Renters with dogs can face tough competition for a limited number of suitable rentals, but our findings highlight where the search might be easier."

Methodology:

BARK's data was compiled from over thirteen years of subscription data for BarkBox and Super Chewer, filtered by dog breed and dog name. Zillow's data was determined by analyzing the share of pet-friendly rentals in the largest 25 cities by population size in the U.S.
