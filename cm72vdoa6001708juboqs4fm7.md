Pets living with their dogs must insert or attach a wireless recognition device into the pet's body when registering animals in the future.This is because the government decided to exclude it from the registration method, as the government pointed out that the existing necklace -type awareness was damaged or had a high risk of falling.

Jeonju City announced on the 4th that as the Enforcement Regulations of the Animal Protection Act are revised, the method of registering as a necklace -type awareness table will be abolished from February 12, next year.

Registration targets are more than two months old, which are raised in housing and associated houses or for other places.Registration can be made by visiting more than 40 animal hospitals in Jeonju, which is designated as an animal registration agency.In the case of an animal registration, a fine of up to 600,000 won is charged according to the animal protection law.

If the registration information, such as the owner's address and phone number, is changed, the change report is made within 30 days from the date of change.Change of registration information can be easily done in the animal protection management system (animal.go.kr).

However, if the animal is registered as an existing tag, it is not necessary to register as an internal and external wireless identification device separately.

The city plans to post this animal registration method on the homepage of Jeonju City (www.Jeonju.go.kr) and actively promote it to the animal hospital in Jeonju area so that citizens are not confused.

Yang Young -gyu, the director of animal welfare department at Jeonju -si, said, “We will move forward as an animal -friendly city by preventing organic animals by setting animal registration.”

On the other hand, the animal owner is separate from the animal registration using the internal and external wireless recognition device Article 13 (Administration of the Registered Animals) in accordance with Article 13 (2).It must be attached.The city is obliged to issue an awareness table to prevent loss and organic even if the perception table is abolished in the animal registration method.
