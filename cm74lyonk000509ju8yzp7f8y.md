From December 15th to 16th, 2018, Gungdimi Fang Cat Festa was held at SETEC for two days.Was it because the impression I received when I visited was too intense?Example, 'Gungdi Fang Cat Festa will be held at setec!'

At that time, there were so many cars that could not park in the SETEC parking lot, so I was able to arrive at the venue only after walking on the vacant lot across the bridge.Returns to the memory of last year, the parking space near Hakyeo Station is also found in advance, and the car will be driven to the Hakyeo -Ul Station where Catfesta will be opened.

Ah!I was proud of it and parked in a parking lot near Hakyeo Station and entered the event.I asked these questions while watching the baby products on display."Is this a person eating?" ... How did you accept these absurd questions from the seller?

Looking closely, I can't see the cat -related products ... and we've learned that we are in the wrong place.The venue is not setEC, but Yangjae Station AT Center ...

I arrived by stepping on my footsteps, and I was able to capture the picture of Gungdimi Fang Cat Festa, the last day of the event.
