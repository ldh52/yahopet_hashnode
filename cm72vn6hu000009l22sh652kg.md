Yongsan -gu, Seoul, will resume the organic animal adoption campaign, which was stopped by the Shinjong Corona Virus infection (Corona 19).

The campaign site is the first Itaewon (in the direction of Noksapyeong Station).Volunteers belonging to 'Organic Animal Happiness (Fashion)' are held every Saturday from 11 am to 5 pm.The trendy company has been a non -profit organic animal adoption organization since 2011.

The animals in the field are the end of the protection period (10 days) under the Animal Protection Act.I usually live in the regional animal hospital, adoption cafe, and temporary protection families. I meet with citizens every Saturday.Most of them are dogs and many cats.

If you want to adopt an organic animal, you can write an application for adoption in the field.A copy of ID card and ID is required.Afterwards, the procedure will be conducted in the linked animal hospital.For blood tests, vaccinations, and neutralization surgery.Adoptees must pay for tests and surgery.

Afterwards, adoptees must inform the trendy news of animal news twice a month.If you are not in touch with the adoptor or suspect organic or abuse, a trend may destroy the adoption process.A dog registration can be registered in the name of the adoptor one year after adoption.

An official of the trendy agency said, "The procedure is somewhat demanding, but it is a family to welcome a life as a family, so please cooperate with joy."

The district is actively supporting the trendy activity as a commitment to the 7th civil service commitment (Yongsan living with pets).The role of the district includes organic animal protection and donation, road occupancy permits, complaints, and support for event goods.

In particular, the district also supports the “Safe Telephone Access System” that records the corona 19 rooms and a list of visits instead of a list of traffickers to resume the campaign.
