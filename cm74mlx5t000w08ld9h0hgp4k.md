Some people met or adopted their dogs again or adopted their dogs, but some people did not find a dog who went home unfortunately.Two months ago, I asked my acquaintance to take care of my dog, but I left the house and went to several places, and I stopped at the Yangju Shelter.

Over time, the time when the sun goes down, the rescue teams who have been dispatched in the morning return one by one, and the animal rescue vehicle operated by the rescue team has a heating and cooling facility.The rescue crews lowered the organic dogs rescued from the rescue vehicle to the facility inside the shelter.The number of rescued organic dogs is more than I thought.

Organic dogs in Seoul and Gyeonggi area!It is the first time to realistically realize the word 'organic dog'.'If people who are dressed in pet policies see this, wouldn't it be a pet policy to actually prevent organic dogs, not organic dogs dealing only by numbers at the desk?'Think about it.

The rescuers who returned to the shelter also disinfected and cleaned the cages and rescue vehicles used.

By the end of the rescue team's preparation for the next day, the sun is shining beyond the horizon.
