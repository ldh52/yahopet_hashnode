On October 24th (Sat), a guardian who missed a dog after missing a lead line occurred at a hospital in Incheon.

The guardian and the guardian who visited the hospital for ophthalmology tested to the hospital were asked to attach the whole complex to find a dog that was lost to the hospital.I wanted to be able to see the hospital visitors by attaching a flyers for a week.

The nurse of the hospital, which was asked by the guardian, said that it would be limited to attaching and holding the newspaper.And 10 minutes later ...

A nurse at the hospital put the flyers in the seizure and washing it.The nurse replied, 'If you just return the leaflet, why do you do it?'

The guardian has protested and apologized to the hospital director.However, the nurse said that he had no apologies for his actions as a public work.

This was what happened at a hospital in Incheon last Saturday.

I hope it is a problem of an individual, not a problem of our society as a whole.

The reporter listened to this story and thought, 'Is it not as a guardian's heart as well as a former complex?'In order to find a dog, I asked the plenary complex to catch the front of the house, and the flyers were saved in the segregation, and I felt that the mind of the guardian who saw it would be shattered.

Wouldn't it be possible to say that I was sorry and sorry to my guardian?

What would you feel if you were in the same situation?When you see a leaflet looking for a beloved dog.Didn't your heart seem to be torn?

It's late, but the nurse wants to think about what his behavior hurt his guardian.Thinking about the situation when he lost his beloved being in the attitude of the station.

The nurse who frowned at the hospital to put a leaflet, and the nurse who had been a trial of the leaflet ... 'Isn't it a cross -section of our society that doesn't understand your companion culture yet?'I hope that what happens in a hospital in Incheon is' nurses' individual matters, not a matter of our society as a whole.
