초록

The purpose of this study was to investigate the changes in body temperature of canine via their hair lengths before and after grooming.

A total of 120 companion canines were used in this study for a total of 6 weeks, and 20 dogs each week consisted of both 10 poodles and 10 malteses (five females and males).

For accurate temperature measurement, the anal depth was measured at approximately 1.5 cm. Temperature before and after grooming was measured at 10 am and after more than three hours, respectively.

There was statistical significance (p<0.05) in body temperature changes for male poodles at 1, 2, and 3 weeks and for female poodles at 1, 3, 4, and 5 weeks, and the total period showed a statistical difference for both male and female poodles (p<0.05).

In addition, male and female malteses had an effect (p<0.05) on changes in body temperature at 1 and 6 weeks and only at 4 weeks, respectively.

For total period, there was a statistical difference in male and female poodles (p<0.05).

Moreover, when the temperature changes of females were compared, there was no remarkable difference.

In conclusion, the body temperatures of both male and female dogs according to the length of their hair were lower after grooming than before grooming.

The measurement of body temperature three hours after grooming, which could reduce stress or other factors, is judged to be able to help customers who are worried about clipping.
