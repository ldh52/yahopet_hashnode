It's been a long time since I introduced Dongjongsu medicine to Korea.Is it about 19 years?

After I introduced it, some veterinarians use homogeneous therapy, and when I listen to the story, I use it 100% commercial.There is no need for the philosophy or concept of homogeneous therapy.

There is a counseling call.

The dog has a tumor (cancer) in the brain, resulting in an orientation-balanced sensation.I was sentenced to one month in the hospital.I have been alive for two months now…I went to the veterinary hospital with homogeneous therapy and got medicine, and I prescribed various kinds of these and more.

I asked the following questions:

“How old are dogs?What is the breed? ”

“It's an old dog.How many years would you like to live after calling me and prescribing the same drug? ”

“Do you think the same therapy is a medicine for treating cancer?How many %do you know cancer treatment rate? ”

“How did you ask your veterinarian (or homogeneous therapy) how many percent of the probability of cure would be administered?

"If homogeneous therapy has a high cancer treatment rate, why aren't the methods actively used in cancer treatment in the medical community?"

“If the cancer was treated with one homogeneous therapy, is it because of the same medicine?Or should I think there was another factor? ”

“The point of view of my medicine-medicine (including the same drug) is this.Soon, the illness is better without taking medicine, and the disease that will not heal is not better if you use a good doctor or medicine.You have inquired to me without knowing what the same is because you want to rely on homogeneous therapy.I think you want to rely on more than treatment. ”

“You told me that you should do everything you can and leave your dog.Do you want a dog to live with a sick body?Or are you wanting?If you have a sick body and your dog has to live longer in pain.Does that really want a dog?Would you not be tortured by a dog? ”

After a while, he had a hard words. “…………“I got enlightenment.thank you."

I healed the dog's mind as a dialogue rather than a trick to treat cancer with homogeneous therapy.Hope Advisor is a cruel torture.Sometimes it may be a way to let go of the reality as it is.

* Philosophical thinking animals have no concept of death.So he is not afraid of death like humans.I know that death is a circulation of life in nature, so I live without thinking.That's why I live happily every day by enjoying the present.I don't live today because of the idea that I can be hunted by a predator tomorrow.The animal instinctively hopes to throw away the body and get a new body when the body hurts.The new body is a circulation of life.It may be the purpose of life that it may be reborn and hope that your genes will be transmitted.For them, life is not important.It is just a number.
