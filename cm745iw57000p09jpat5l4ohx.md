In my memory, even if I went to college, people lined up in front of each toilet door in the bathroom.But this is a bokbulbok.Even if I stand first, the order changes depending on which of the toilet door.Even if you entered the bathroom late, it was a system that could use the toilet before the person who came in first.Obviously, the person next to me came later than me, and I often saw my work before me.Of course, so sometimes I used to fight.

It was the smallest but most urgent thing in my life, and it was a time when I felt the most irrational system.It is the beginning of social dissatisfaction.

However, when this system has changed from time to time.Now we wait in line at the entrance of the bathroom, not in front of the door.Regardless of which toilet door is opened first, you can enter the order standing in the row in front of the entrance to the bathroom.Nobody is dissatisfied.Only five steps were moved back and changed to a system where everyone was satisfied.Only 2-3 meters back and lined up, you can see everything and democracy.Everyone is fair.First initiation is possible.

A wise method is also needed to solve the elevator bottleneck.

The same is true for the elevator.

Sometimes there's a work in a building, so it's not upset when you go to work.The elevator is limited to the tens of floors, and there is no solution to each elevator, no matter how much it is divided into odds, evens, low and high floors.People are roughly lined up, and when the elevator comes down from the top, the line suddenly disappears and tries to ride.And the problem is that the elevator that loses the first time comes down first, and someone rides down in the middle of the coming down and eventually comes down the late.Dissatisfaction with the current system is accumulated.Obviously, the elevator is not a prejudice.

In this case, the most wise way is to line up.Behind the elevator, it is to install and line up for everyone to stand up to two meters.Then, as soon as the door opens, you can guide people to ride the elevator capacity.It is the same concept as building a line in front of the bathroom.Then you will burn in the order of the elevator.Reasonable.Everyone can wait comfortably.

It's only a little back to see everything.If you step back, everything changes reasonably.Not only an elevator shows, but you can see the situation of all elevators going down and going up.If you see everything, you will feel comfortable.

There must be courage and room to retreat a little bit

The business is especially true.If you have a problem, you have to get out of it.It's sad, but on the old battlefield, the commander has always left the top of the mountain, and the soldiers had to move as the flags were shaking and the trumpet was blowing.It was not important for how many soldiers died, but how it was more important.I can see it from far away.Have you ever seen a movie where the commander jumped into and fights?The same is true of business.The business is a game game.It is like a person who has a hunting person better than a person who has an organs.

Only after retreat is seen.In particular, ventures are more so.The POOL of the workforce to hear advice around is relatively weak.No, maybe sometimes the ventures are blocked by themselves.It is the same as it sticks to the elevator or the toilet door.You need to create an environment where you can retreat a little bit of systematic or system.There must be <courage> and <Hari> to back a little.Don't be in a hurry.That way, you can make creative decisions.You can find a hand that can win.

Don't stick too much to everything.The world is only as much as my vision.You can see more until you step back.
