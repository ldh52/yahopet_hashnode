On June 16 and 17, 2018, the 8th Gungdimi Fang Cat Festa (hereinafter referred to as Gungdi Pang) was held at the AT Center in Yangjae -dong, Seoul for two days.Despite the opening of 10 o'clock, the entrance has already become the best product for cat guardians, so that the entrance has already lined up.

At the event, more than 240 companies participated in more than 500 booths, making them realistic as the origin of the cat exhibition.Visitors were also a successful exhibition with about 20,000 people.

The venue was divided into the first and second floors, and the first floor assigned companies with its own scale.For example, Korea's feed, which is a leader in domestic pet food manufacturing, has been assigned to the industry, including Sajo -dong Awon, Neural Balance, Dreampet Food, Pet Mania, Palpia Outlet, and Korean Cat Sand Research Institute.On the other hand, the second floor assigned a relatively small one -person company or a small company.

Companies on the first floor mainly promoted and sample products, and even if they are sold, they set the price in the medium line of the pet shop or wholesale price, and block the decrease in sales of local wholesalers, agents, and pet shops due to the sale of the exhibitions of the exhibition.I wanted to.In other words, if you sell things cheaply at the exhibition, it is to prevent the Buddha's death in which consumers wait for the exhibition, buy goods at the exhibition, and not go to the pet shop or veterinary hospital in the neighborhood.

On the other hand, the second floor reminiscent of a huge cat's marketplace, and in the form, the booth was placed and the customer's movement was also made.Products were given and other related products made by individuals and small companies.It did not overlap with the pet shop products, but it also sold products that were not so problematic.

Seo Jung -ae, CEO of Gungdi Pang Pang, said, “I planned Gungdimang Pang to solve the inconvenience I had as a cat guardian and as a cat seller.When I sold cat supplies, there was no market and I had a lack of economic ability to use the distribution network.So I focused online, but it was also lacking, so I showed Gungdi Pang for a small person like me six years ago.So, without forgetting such a beginner, the second floor is assigned to the small -scale business owners who are relatively weak. ”

Seo also said, “When the exhibition is held, I am so sorry to know that it affects the sales of pet shops and distributors near the exhibition.Therefore, companies and goods that can affect this part are all assigned to the first floor and focus on publicity if possible, and if you think you are going to refrain from selling or sell it, please sell it similar to the market price.I ask. ”

This year, about half of the 40 exhibitions will be held and half of them will be held.The exhibition is not an outlet that sells things cheaply.However, the pet industry exhibition is becoming a 'lowest price discount burial', unless anyone's fault or anyone intended.This has become an uncomfortable culture for all of the pet industries in the area where the seller or the exhibition is held at the exhibition.

Lee Jung -ae, who is so good at this, is running Gungdimpang in search of his own way.The pet industry is getting bigger and the area is increasing.Naturally, in the industry, conflicts are inevitable and competition is required.This is natural again.But if we all yield a little and we all think it's a family of the pet industry, there will be a way of win -win.In that sense, I think that the concerns and practices of Seo Jung -ae's representative of Gungdi Fang Cat Festa should be appreciated.Daum Gungdi Pang will be held at Setec, Seoul Hakhyeoul Station on December 16th.At this time, I look forward to the exhibition that smells more coexistence.
