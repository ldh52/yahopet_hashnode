In 2019, the literature 'Animal and Happy', which was organized by Konkuk University, was held.It is a series of lectures, which are companions that both people and animals could think of a happy coexistence.-Addivier Note-

In August 27 (Tue), Konkuk University's pet humanities were the fifth time, and Kim Jong -un's “Win ​​-Win Story” was held as an animal symbol.Lecturer Kim Jong -un, a former researcher at Konkuk University and Literature Research Institute, tells the story of animals in Korea's founding myths and traditional fairy tales, and explained the meaning of the meaning in it.

'Why is a person who is born through animal mothers?', 'What is the image that comes to mind?'Asked the attendees about the back and solved the classic story from a modern perspective.

The following is the main contents of the lecture of literature.

▶ 'Why is a god born through animal mothers?'

Through the bears and tigers in the story of the Dangun Wanggum, the epic principle of 'Dangun Myth' explained.The bear, which appeared as a mother of Dangun, ate mugwort and garlic, which means the movement from hunting to agricultural society.

It tells the story of animals in mythology and fairy tales.

▶ 'What is the image that comes to mind?'

What is the mother of a fox?The fox has positive and negative images in history.Positive images include 'foresight that human beings do not see, conversation with ghosts, unusual beings', and negative images are' to be 'and confusing the order of the human world.'

▶ 'Why is the hero born through the animal father?'

The story of the animal father is the story of Baekje Muwang and Hubaekje.

Why is the father of Baekje Muwang? The combination of dragons (the gods of water) means that water has become important in agricultural culture, and that the productivity of agriculture is important.

What is the identity of a man coming at night?

Hubaekje's father is a big earthworm.There is also a story that Wang Gun also sprayed salt on the Nakdong River to overcome the dog, and that the king was a failed king.

▶ When you need to open a new era and change the age of change, we seek divinity with animal attributes.

▶ 'When is it when humans combine with animals?'

When it is difficult to live a life based on existing cultural standards, the combination with animals appears.However, in the old story, the bear's mother is limited to Woongjin's Bear Legend and Legend.This means that the bears that are likely to have a great influence of maternity society and hunting culture are people.Animal mothers and animal fathers seek and disappear with animal values ​​in the changing times.Today we need pets like dogs and cats.

▶ Which animal appears the most in the old Korean story?

It is a tiger.(In Dangun mythology) The tiger is the main character in the story?

The tiger ... It functions to rethink the meaning of human life, while it also threatens human beings, a way of life that is not assimilated to human beings, a way of life that does not assimilate to humans.

▶ What is the image that comes to mind when a tiger?

The story of 'Hae -nim', which is famous for 'not eat if you give one rice cake', and the story of 'Haen -nim', who are familiar with us, were expressed differently depending on the artist who expresses it.

The tigers in the works such as 'Haen -nim Moon (Song Jae -chan Written, Lee Jong -mi)'Cute and foolishly, sometimes scary.

In the story of 'If you give me a rice cake, you don't eat it', the tiger is 'different from us, and we have our appearance (constantly greedy).'

▶ The reason why animals became a symbol of human life

I think that the behavior of the animals is more than just an action, and the symbol can be considered as a device that extends the essential meaning to another meaning.Animals have a variety of meanings rather than one meaning, and they are expanding their meanings through stories.

Instructor Kim Jong -un tells the story of 'Land Guban Prahu', which is handed down from Indonesia.

Instructor Kim Jong -un, who told the founding myth and the animal in the traditional fairy tale, told the story of Gunung Tangkuban Perahu in Indonesia.'Land Guban Prafu' means 'a mountain with a stomach.'This story contains the contents of foreign bodies, murder, and incest.The story of the story is summarized as follows.

① Princess Indonesia lived, and the princess did not try to marry any prince.The king was angry and sent the princess to the forest.The princess made clothes in the forest, and he would marry a man who helped him.

② When a dog called 'Tu Mang' appeared with clothes, the princess married Tu Mang and gave birth to a son.

③ The growing son took a dog with a dog and killed the dog (tu mang) when the deer was not caught.The son said it was a deer meat and ate it with his mother, and he replied that the meat went.The angry mother hit her son and hurt her head, leaving her son ...

④ In the years, the son was gong, and on the way back to his hometown, he met a pretty woman, fell in love, and decided to marry.A pretty woman sees the wound of the head and knows that she is her son, and she says she is a mother, but she says she will marry unconditionally.Mom says that he will stop the river called Tatatamun for a day, make a lake and get a boat to get married.

⑤ When the son tries to do these things in one day, the mother makes you cry earlier at dawn.The son knew it was dawn, and he couldn't get married and stopped.The angry son was deceived, and he threw his stomach, and at this time, there was a mountain called 'Guban Prafu'.) '

⑥ The son who kept looking for her mother threw herself into the lake.

The interpretation of this story is as follows.

▶ Why did the prince, who is an animal father, became a hero who failed?

Dodo Princess and Dog Fair Marriage, Father's Dog kills his son, the son who wants to marry his mother, and the elements that reveal the original and in -depth desires of the son who wants to marry their mother, but make the stomach in one day, but the mother worldThe willingness to stay in is broken.

▶ Turn -up pear

Not to stay in a fixed life, but to go beyond heterogeneous culture through exchange with animals, and to create a new culture to become a hero of your own life.

The pear was not in the lake that was blocked by the river, but the purpose was to sail the river and the vast sea.

Kim Jong -un talked about his thoughts about the win -win story of animal symbols.

"We want to be familiar with the familiar animals, the animals that listen well, the animal that can be done at will, and the animal that is tamed according to the way of human life.It is important to feel it through the story.

"If you raise your children, you don't have a child who listens well. The same is true. The view of heterogeneous animals, other animals ... Don't be afraid of heterogeneous things, don't think it's an opportunity to develop me."

"We don't think that we are the owner and the animal is that we support us, and we want to tell that we are only a pet dog or a cat.To interact with an animal is to connect to my life.

'It is not to stay in a fixed life, but to go beyond heterogeneous culture by exchanges with animals, to create a new culture to become a hero of your own life'It is a story from Kim Jong -un's instructor.

Bear in Dangun mythology, foxes in the story of General Kang Gam -chan, the story of Baekje Muwang, the earthworm of Baekje dogs, the tigers of the moon, and the dogs in Guban Prahufu, Indonesia.I took it again as an adult.I heard a different meaning from the story I heard when I was young, through a companion literature, and had time to think about win -win with animals.

The answer to the pet story that this era needs and how to make the story seems to be hiding in the old story.If you are curious about the animal story told to adults, please attend your companion literature.
