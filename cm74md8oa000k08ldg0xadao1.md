It was a turn lounge that I visited late in the evening.The turn lounge is a long -standing structure, and the atmosphere of eating will vary that day depending on where you take your seat.

There is a U -shaped table, there is a right angle table like a cafe, and there is an outdoor table as you first came in, and a room for group teams.

And there is one more table at the end of the rectangular space, so you can eat while looking at the night view of the window.On the day I visited, I settled here and ordered 'Cheese Pork cutlet' from the meal menu.I just got up from the province, so I was hungry, but I ate the money cutlet as if it were hidden.

There was a friend who greeted us since entering the lounge, which is Bichon Prize 'Kongyi'.The beans, which are now 8 months old, come to the side and pretend to know.In addition to the beans, there are two more dogs, and two are home.
