Namhae -gun will promote the “Madang Neutralization and Surgery Support” project from next year to increase the number of individuals and prevent organic dogs due to the lack of management of the yard.

The target of the support is that the 5 -month -old yard is raised outdoors, and if there are many applicants, the priority (the owner is a basic living recipient, a second class, a senior citizen over 65 years old, or a medium -sized mix)You will receive it.

The business volume is about 140, and the budget of 52 million won is invested, and the cooperative animal hospital will be selected in consideration of accessibility and designation of animal registration agencies.

On the other hand, the unregistered dog can be neutralized after registering animals.

Kimdo's livestock prevention team said, “We will actively promote the neutralization of the yard, and we will create an environment where people and animals can coexist happily by controlling populations.”
