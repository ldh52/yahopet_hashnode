Wag! (Wag! Group Co., Nasdaq: PET) today(April 29) reveals the highly anticipated rebrand of Dog Food Advisor (DFA) - the U.S.’s leading pet food review and advice site.

The improved, expanded and more user-friendly design continues to provide unbiased reviews, science-based consumer-focused content, and updates on dog food recalls for its community, improving pets' and their parents' lives. Dog Food Advisor also partners with a number of best-in-class brands, helping them successfully navigate the ever-growing competition in the pet food and treat space.

"The Dog Food Advisor rebrand is a major step forward in our mission to become the most trusted resource for pet parents everywhere," said Garrett Smallwood, CEO and Chairman of Wag!. "By creating a more engaging and user-friendly platform, we're not only making the pet food experience more enjoyable and valuable for pet owners, but also strengthening our partnerships with leading brands like Chewy, The Farmer's Dog, and Ollie. Ultimately, this allows us to tap deeper into the vast potential of the pet food TAM."

In addition to the rebrand, DFA has launched a white labeled version of its proprietary Dog Food Calculator, which allows pet parents to receive personalized dog food recommendations. The experience debuted with Vox Media's The Dodo as a launch partner, immediately providing millions of pet parents with an easy solution for choosing the best food for their dog's diet. DFA is excited to offer the white labeled experience to additional large partners in the coming months.

Wag!, which strives to be the number one platform to solve the service, product, and wellness needs of the modern U.S. pet household, acquired DFA in January 2023.
