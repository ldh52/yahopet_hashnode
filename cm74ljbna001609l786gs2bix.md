- The national natural recreational forest operation is close to the concept of space and dog pension by distinguishing between the general public and companion.

Last Sunday, where showers had fallen everywhere, I visited the Sanum National Natural Recreation Forest in Yangpyeong (July 2019)

The Korea Forest Service has revised the public opinion that the government is uncomfortable with the ban on pets of 40 national natural recreational forests nationwide, and revised the “Regulations on the Installation and Management of the National Natural Recreation Forest” on May 1, 2018.It was possible to enter the pet animals.

The pilot operation until August 31, 2019 due to the revision of this regulation is the National Natural Recreation Forest (Yangpyeong, Gyeonggi -do) and the National Natural Recreation Forest (Gyeongbuk Nutrition).The Gummasan Recreation Forest can be used with pets with accommodation and camping facilities, and plans to operate additional this year.

The space for the general recreational and pet recreational guests is separated.As you move to the car, you will see the signs on the crossroads and drive in the direction of 'National Mountain Natural Recreation Forest (1km)'.Next to the big letters, there is a direction to go to the dog playground, which is not easy for visitors to discover.

It is not easy to find a sign on the crossroads and the direction of the dog playground at first sight.

After about 1km uphill, you can see the recreational forest ticket office.When asked where to go with a dog, I go down the road and tell me to go to the dog playground.

The national recreational forest had to pay the entrance fee and parking fee. The parking fee is 3,000 won and the entrance fee is 1,000 won per person.After calculating the parking fee and admission fee at the ticket office, we go down the mountain and head to the dog playground.Of course, there is a ticket office on the dog's playground.

Move 2.6km along the milestone to arrive at the dog playground.

When you travel by car, you can see the dog playground.There is a shelter like a pension in the forest, and there is a dog playground underneath.

I was able to meet my companions who spent time with their families in search of a dog playground.

When I first thought about visiting this place, I thought, 'Would it be a place where you can feel the freshness of nature by walking with your dog with your dog.'However, when I actually come, I meet the pension in the forest rather than that, and I meet the recreational forest where a dog playground is prepared.

I used to walk around Gyejosan in Daejeon.I thought of walking with a dog with a dog barefoot with a dog, but rather than looking at the pensions and a large playground in the countryside.This size of playground is likely to be similar to a dog playground in Boramae Park in Seoul.

The National Natural Recreation Forest where you can go with your dog ... Well, it is not good to operate the space where the general public and companions can go.If the place where you can go together is not a promenade in the forest, I think it's better to use a dog dog playground near the neighborhood rather than looking for a dog playground.

It seems to be a half policy to operate a dog playground in the forest pension or shelter.To be able to walk along the forest with a dog ... This is a policy for the creation of a true 'dog can be accompanied by a dog' and is it not the national natural recreational forest that many companions expect?
