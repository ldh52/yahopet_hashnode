Many people use calming chews to relieve their pet's anxiety, especially during the July 4 holiday. Not only can the sound of fireworks scare your pet, but a change in routine or sudden influx of visitors can cause pets great distress. While these supplements can help calm your pet, they can also be dangerous if taken in too great of a quantity.

"I had just moved to a new apartment, and I ran out to do some grocery shopping," explained Jacque Dickson, who lives with her dogs Elton and Chubbs in Greensboro, North Carolina. "My father had recently bought a bottle of calming chews for Chubbs, who can be anxious. The bottle was in an unopened box, but the dogs managed to get into it and consume the entire bottle of more than 160 chews. My first call was to the pet emergency room, and they had me call Pet Poison Helpline before I even left the house." By calling first, the toxicology experts at Pet Poison Helpline were able to start developing a recommended treatment plan based on Elton and Chubbs' individual situations that could be ready when Dickson arrived at the clinic.

"After talking with the experts at Pet Poison Helpline, they determined that Chubbs was not in danger because of his size," Dickson explained. "He's a fit cattle dog, but he's 65 pounds. Because Elton is only 10 pounds, they recommended I take him into the hospital for treatment and observation."

As soon as Dickson arrived at Carolina Veterinary Specialists in Greensboro, the medical team was ready to start treatment. The Pet Poison Helpline team had determined that Elton had consumed a dangerous level of the product, which contains tryptophan. The toxicologists were concerned with Elton developing hypernatremia due to the number of chews he ingested, potentially causing a fluid shift that results in increased sodium concentrations. There was also a concern for serotonin syndrome to develop, which causes numerous neurologic and cardiovascular signs, due to the amount of L-tryptophan ingested. With this in mind, the specialists at Pet Poison Helpline recommended an antiemetic, electrolyte monitoring, intravenous fluids and monitoring for serotonin syndrome, a condition that happens when there is too much serotonin in the body.

"The dedicated team at Carolina Veterinary Specialists took great care of Elton," said Dr. Renee Schmid, a senior veterinary toxicologist and director of Veterinary Medicine at Pet Poison Helpline. "He was closely monitored overnight and went home the next day, where Ms. Dickson could monitor both him and Chubbs for any additional symptoms or changes in behavior."

Accidental medication poisoning is only one of the risks facing pets during the July 4 holiday. An even greater threat is pets being terrified by the loud fireworks explosions or getting out of the house and into other dangers such as being hit by a car. Pet Poison Helpline has partnered with AKC Reunite, the nation's largest not for profit pet recovery service, offering its 24/7 toxicology expertise as an optional, unlimited benefit for its members to add to their pet's lifetime protection.
