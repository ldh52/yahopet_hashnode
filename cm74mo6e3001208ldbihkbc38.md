A premium pet show was held at KINTEX last weekend (June20), and the size and visitors were reduced compared to the former.Sellers and visitors were participating in the corona 19 prevention through “social distance”.

While watching the fair, I was able to find a booth that attracted attention.

The dog's clothes are drawn to the booth and listen to the brand.The following is an introduction to the plumps that the CEO of Plumpi has heard.

"Plumfi is a brand that thought of Podong Poong Fat Obesity Dogs. We have a brand name in the idea of ​​not being alienated for obese dogs, and we are producing products with optimized patterns for each breed through pattern studies that fit the breed."

Plumpi is a brand that considers obese dogs and cares.

"Plumfi is planning to implement the optimized pattern as an app using augmented reality (AR) through the study of dog patterns. We are developing a virtual fitting system for virtually when purchasing clothes."

Last year, when I met A -Al Cookies, I was able to see a case where augmented reality is applied to the pet field.It is said that it is a fitting system that is virtually dressed in dogs.When the development of the plumy virtual fitting system is completed, it will meet again at the pet fair.

Plump will introduce a virtual fitting system using augmented reality.

"Plumfi has been opening its design before product production since this year, and customers are producing products after voting. We have recorded the name of the participating customers in the house of the product.

Customer participation brand!This is the direction of the plum.The customer selects the design he prefers, and based on this, the product is produced.And the name of the customer who participated in the product is recorded.Customers do not produce directly, but they will participate in the production.I think a new product comes out, and I think that a product that reflects my opinion is coming out, so if you actually receive the product, it will remain compared to other products.

Plumfi aims to be a customer -participated brand

Due to the influence of Corona 19, the offline market, including the pet fair, has shrunk a lot.Unlike the previous year, it was not a crowded fair, but it was a good opportunity to meet and talk with companies that are challenging pet markets with new attempts like plums.

Brands that consider obesity dogs, brands that develop a virtual fitting system using augmented reality, customer participation brand, plumy!

It is expected that the challenges of the young people, centered on Kang Young -hye, will energize the pet industry.
