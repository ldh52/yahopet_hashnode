In 2019, the literature 'Animal and Happy', which was organized by Konkuk University, was held.It is a series of lectures, which are companions that both people and animals could think of a happy coexistence.-Addivier Note-

Introducing the third meaning of the true 'invisible life', which is a true 'accompaniment' viewed by a companion literary film and literature.

Koh Kyung -sun's instructor explains about the 'invisible life of life': the movie 'Cat Kardy': Beautiful coexistence of humans and animals ▲ Death of cats -the failure and possibility of coexistenceI did it.

▶ Movie 'Cat Caddy'

Kedy is a Turkish word called a cat.In the Catdie Catdie, the cats coexist with humans in Islamic Turkey.Cats who walk around the streets with people, cats who are taking a nap ... It is unimaginable in our capital Seoul.

The instructor Ko Kyung -sun interpreted the following interpretation with the cats in the film.

△ Love for animals is also linked to love for humans.△ Responsibility for weak and marginalized life △ Recognition that the problems of street animals and the problems of people are not irrelevant.

In an anecdote about Muhammad Ali and his cat Mueja, he explained the minimum attitude of humans and animals to live together."If you don't have a glass of water in the afterlife, don't touch it."

▶ Cat's death -search for coexistence and possibility of coexistence

The description of the cat's death was given through two books, including Hwang Jung -eun's short novel 'Mystery' and Park Deok -gyu's short novel 'Rest of Cats'.

Hwang Jung -eun's novel 'Paisi's Introduction'

Hwang Jung -eun criticizes human -centeredism through the seedlings/grave motifs.The common idea of ​​people about cats and the elderly is 'unpleasant' through the form of a nation named 'body' and the edge of 'Gok -Ci Senior'.

'Is it because of the pierced gaze of the people looking at Catmam and Catdadi, the gaze is also due to human -centered unpleasant?'The following is related to this described in the novel.

'The old man who lives and eats food on the plates on the floor, stairs, or anyway, or the merchants who live in a mysterious, that is unable to say that it is possible for himself, is uncomfortable even if there is no annoying or harmful harm.I was unpleasant and unpleasant and unpleasant.

The cats appearing in the seedlings appear as a cat who lived five times.The cats and people who met the cat 'body' in each life ... The novel is vividly described.

What will it look like if you look at people with the eyes of a cat?

'My people who meet in the mall were often nervous and nervous.I was experiencing threats routinely, and I usually had a poor hungry or worship because I couldn't eat it properly.I thought that all the cats in the world were having a hungry face.

'Human was our great natural enemy.Above all, considering that at least three direct causes of death were thrown in the middle of these five deaths, something in the head, or kicked up, the complaint that there was no natural enemy in the cat considering the fact that there were at least three direct causes of death in humans.It's just a funny story to underestimate. "

The appearance of the cat and the human figure ... The cat who lives five times in the eyes ... I'm sorry and sorry.

Park Deok -gyu's novel collection'Save the cat '

Park Deok -gyu's short novel 'Cat Restie' sees cats as coexistence.This work is seeking to restore relationships with them by saving cat life.

One day, he tries to turn away from the cat, who meets the house, but when he encounters that eye, he meets the eyes of his eyes.

'The white hair flowing from one eye to the forehead was not eaten properly, so it was like a young child who had a blood.I stopped my mouth, I woke up to one side with my heel, and I tried not to meet the cat's eyes, but unfortunately I met with the sad eyes of the cat who was dragging to lift my head. '

'Under the eyebrows that seemed to be dazzling in the morning sun, I only knew that I was dragged into the transparent eyes that I was unknown.'

People believe that it does not exist unless it is visible.When you see the invisible, when there is something that does not exist, it is a courageous behavior that you do not know and practice it.

▶ Restoration of courtesy and ethics for death

Explaining this part, Ko Kyung -sun introduced the 2003 Nobel Prize -winning winner 'Fall'.The protagonist in this novel is a white man who lives in South Africa, where the Apartheid (racist policy) was carried out.The novel shows the fall of the protagonist who lived a wealthy life, and the gaze of animals in the journey of life is changing.

'Fall' is a novel that explores the causes of black and white conflict and violence on the stage of South Africa, where racism policy was carried out.

Below is the idea of ​​an animal seen by a white man who lives a rich life.

'To talk about animals, mobilize all means and treat them kindly.But don't lose balance.We are a creature different from animals.It's not necessarily higher, it's just different.So if you want to be kind to the animals, you are not guilty or afraid of retaliation, but in a simple amount. '

'They are part of the furniture and are only part of the alarm system.They treat us like a god, and we treat them as things. '

'The pastors of the church have been discussing them for a long time, and eventually they concluded that they had no right soul.Because their souls are in close contact with the body, they die when they die. '

It can be said that it shows the values ​​of human -centered values ​​and animals as a machine.

The protagonist in the novel had human -centered values ​​for animals.

With the economic downturn of the protagonist, the protagonist works to deal with the carcasses of the animal, and he supports people to see the animal's carcasses.

'He thought he would get used to it.But that doesn't work, he actually must go home on a Lucy van in a Sunday evening, and keep his car on the side of the road.Tears that can't stop flow down.His hand trembles.He doesn't understand what happens to them. '

'Why did he choose that?But the dog is dead.What do dogs know about honor and disgrace?Then for himself.The world he thinks, for a world where there are no people who tap the body with a shovel to make it easier to handle. '

'Now he is the person who sees the dog.Dog doctor, dog wedding, Harijan (the lowest level of India) '

The protagonist, who witnessed the death of an animal in the invisible life, the invisible realm, feels compassion for it and cares for them at the lowest.

Koh Kyung -sun explained that he is seeking reconciliation through compassion and empathy about the protagonist in the novel 'Fall'.

The lecture on the literature of the companion is held every Tuesday at Konkuk University Life Science Museum.

The lecture on the literary literature was held at the Konkuk University Life Science Museum under the theme of 'the meaning of' true 'in the film and literature.The lectures, which were held on Tuesday, September 24th, can be seen about 'what is a true companion with animals?'It was time.

Although each of them had to be explained and discussed for a long time in itself, it seemed to be able to help the attendees understand it by looking at movies and literature.

I would like to express my gratitude to the instructor of Ko Kyung -sun for making it easy to understand the difficult topics, and I would like to think that many people have time to think about their companion and coexistence with their companion literature.Introducing the lectures that will lead to the future with the hope that many people will be together.
