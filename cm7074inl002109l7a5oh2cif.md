BARK, Inc. (NYSE: BARK), the leading global omnichannel dog brand, today(June 12) announced the expansion of BARK Air, the world's first air travel experience designed specifically for dogs first, and their human companions second, with five new destinations and seven new routes both domestically and internationally in response to customer demand.

Building on the momentum since BARK Air first took flight last month between New York (HPN) and Los Angeles (VNY), and New York (HPN) and London (BQH), the company will now help dogs and their humans travel comfortably and conveniently to the metro areas of Paris (LBG), Chicago (MDW), San Francisco/San Jose (SJC), Phoenix (PHX), and Miami/Fort Lauderdale (FXE). Flights for the new routes are available for booking today at DogsFlyFirst.com and begin taking off this October.

"The interest and enthusiasm around BARK Air to date have been overwhelming," said Matt Meeker, Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer of BARK. "We are excited to expand BARK Air's service to new cities and through new routes, accommodating customer demand and bringing our unique, stress-free dog-centric travel experience to even more families."

BARK Air takes the white glove experience typical of a human's first-class experience and redirects all that pampering to pooches - from booking to arrival, to in-flight services and disembarkation, dogs are the VIPs and treated to a positively luxurious, curated experience.

Following booking, humans are contacted by a BARK Air concierge to collect information about each dog and their human's travel plans to ensure the best possible experience. On travel day, dogs and their companions arrive at the airport 60 minutes before takeoff for a simple, efficient check-in process where dogs can meet other furry friends on their flight - no crates or stressful lines.

Before boarding, a highly skilled BARK Air concierge will welcome dogs at the gate to help them settle into their experience through socialization and dog-centric cabin preparation. The BARK Air concierge also evaluates each dog to ensure they are enjoying their experience and adapting to the new environment and if additional attention and care are needed prior to boarding or once on board.

Also prior to boarding, the plane is treated to a "Dogs Fly First" flight prep with calming pheromones, music, and colors that pups prefer. All furry passengers have access to various aids such as calming treats, noise-canceling ear muffs, and calming jackets to ensure a stress-free and enjoyable flight.

Once onboard, dogs are served a snack or beverage of choice during ascent and descent to ensure they do not experience any ear discomfort commonly caused by changes in cabin pressure. Additionally, a variety of BARK-branded treats, snacks, and surprises are provided throughout the flight with the intent of pampering furry passengers and their humans.

An Argus Platinum-rated charter company is responsible for all aircraft, crew, maintenance, and insurance-related matters, while BARK is focused on creating and delivering a world-class air travel experience for dogs and their people.

Westchester County voluntarily dismissed its lawsuit against BARK on June 10, which at no time impacted BARK Air's operations. BARK Air will continue to operate flights to and from HPN.
