The Ministry of Science and ICT's Friendship Business Division (Director Park Jong-seok) will issue a total of 672,000 copies of two joint stamps along with Russian friendship on December 15 in the year of the Korea-Russian cultural exchange.

Russia is a key partner of the new North Korean policy, and has maintained friendly relations with Korea in various fields such as political and economic cooperation, cultural and human exchanges, and energy through more than 30 summit meetings since 1990.

The co -stamp contains the appearance of the half -moon bear and Russian brown bears of Korea, the representative wild animals of the two countries.

The number of individuals dropped sharply due to the seawater relief project, poaching and reducing habitats in the name of removing harmful beasts during the Japanese colonial period.In 2005, the Ministry of Environment has been designated as an endangered endangered wildlife level.The length of the half -moon bear is usually 130-190 cm and the weight of 150-200 kg, and the average life expectancy in the wild is about 20 years.

Russian Bear Bear has a wide forehead and small ears, so the head is slender than the half -breasted bear.The body length is 190-280 cm, the weight is usually 200-400 kg, and the average life expectancy in the wild is about 50 years.

Park Jong -seok, head of the Korea Postal Business Division, said, “I hope that the friendship between the two countries of Korea and Russia will be more solid, such as the Korean half -breasted bear and Russian brown bear in this joint stamp.”

The commemorative stamps can be purchased by visiting the nearest Sacred Agency or applying to the Internet Post Office (www.epost.go.kr).
