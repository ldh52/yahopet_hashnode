The purpose of the installation is a kind of convenience device that allows the guardian to hang the lines of the pet and use the two hands freely or to keep the pets still in that place.

If a pet misses the line, the pet can run in the direction that the pet does not want.If you are out of control, you may be able to move at a faster speed than your guardian, which may be difficult to find or if you are severely lost.

In general, the place where you are installed is installed in a parking lot that needs to be transferred from the car, the entrance to open the door, the elevator to wait, and the inside of the inside of the entrance.

Outside the house, it is installed at the outside of the pet aircraft or the pet partner facility in the exterior of the store that does not enter the pet.

The form of such a lead hook is sold with a regular ring type and a lock.

Products with functions with aesthetics and various functions are still difficult to find in Korea.In addition to the silk hooks, various pet products are expected to be cheaper and good quality products.

Petheim has a small one and has the required options for pets and guardians.
