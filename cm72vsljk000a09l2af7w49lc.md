Busan Geumjeong -gu (Gu Jung Mi -young) continues the open conversation with the residents to listen to the vivid voices of the residents until October 28, starting with Geumseong -dong on October 6th.

The open dialogue with the residents was promoted to listen to opinions on the site and reflect it in the budget in 2021 so that the inconvenience of residents was not alienated due to the concentration of administrative power in the corona 19 response.

Residents who attended the dialogue checked the current status of major current issues in 2020, opened with Geumsam, and created a space for teenagers, including common interests, such as improving traffic jams after the opening of Yunsan Tunnel, and developing space for youth and ice pack recycling projects.In various topics, such as a plan, we had a time to talk to regional development.Instead of residents who could not attend, they also delivered civil complaints such as road conservatives and street lamps.

In addition, after the event, the company promised to visit and check the site with the chairman and actively review the solution.The district will examine the questions and suggestions made in the field in the priority of the next year and to secure the budget.

Jung Mi -young, the head of Geumjeong -gu, said, â€œWe have been on -site communication since the inauguration of the ward office, but this year, the situation was not easy due to the 19 long -term corona."I'm new to the people and listen to the voices of the residents."
