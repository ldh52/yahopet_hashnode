GoBoat, an innovator in personal adventure watercraft, proudly showcases its innovative dog dock ramp, making it easier than ever to bring your furry four-legged companions along for any adventure.

About GoBoat

The GoBoat Dog Dock is designed to enhance the safety and enjoyment of both you and your pets. This inflatable attachment provides a convenient way for your pet to enter and exit the water or return to your GoBoat without the hassle of splashing, hoisting, or pulling.

Maybe you don't have a pet? The Dog Dock can double as a human hammock! This multifunctional attachment can offer an easy way for humans to climb back up on the GoBoat.

The Dog Dock features submersible mesh stairs, making it easy for your pup to find traction underwater and navigate to the platform without assistance. The mesh ramp can hold the weight of a 250-pound companion! Plus, the platform features plenty of space for them to lounge, shake, and sunbathe alongside your GoBoat. The dock is arched to compliment the curve of any of our GoBoat models at any angle, attaching seamlessly to the back, front, or side of your craft for long days on the water, fishing or hunting excursions, and casual scouting floats.

The Dog Dock is here for you and your furry best friends to enjoy the water!

No more waiting in lines at the boat launch. GoBoat models, including the Dog Dock, can be inflated - and deflated - from a trunk or truck bed and launched from any beach, cove, or park.

The bright colors made this item easy to see for your pup!

Simply clip it onto your GoBoat for a secure attachment. More space for them means more space for you - while our GoBoat models leave space for your furry companions, the extra square footage offered by the Dog Dock frees up space on your craft for more equipment, supplies, or snacks. You don't have to compromise!

#### The perfect companion for adventures on the water, the GoBoat Dog Dock features:

- Bright colors for maximum visibility and safety on the water.
- Durable, submersible mesh stairs with weights and grip bars for easy access.
- Added square footage and surface area for your dog to lounge on.
- Lightweight, durable materials - the Dog Dock weighs just 14 lbs.
- Virtually impenetrable anti-slip PVA decking and Armorlite material, when de-inflated can fit into a compact bag, small enough to fit in the trunk or a closet.
- Your purchase includes a carry bag, pump, patch kit, and two dock connects for easy attachment to your GoBoat craft.

"Our goal for the GoBoat Dog Dock is to provide pet owners with innovative solutions that make outdoor experiences with their beloved companions even better.
