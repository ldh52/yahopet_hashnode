'Independent bookstore Presscent 14, located in Seonyudo Station, is a space where the book and the owner of the bookstore are directly steered.There have been a total of 10 kinds of fragrances that have been made of books, and we have been working with various publishers and bookstores.I wanted to contain the story in the book so that I can enjoy the book more abundantly and deeper the fragrance.I hope that the words in the fragrance will be delivered to the precious people, and as with books, I hope to give us a little bit of time to our daily lives. '

Many people visited Precent 14.Many books were on the bookshelf, and there were blinds in the middle.

Cat festival held in Seonyu Village…It was a time and place to experience and experience the culture of the place as well as the flea market.There were only four of the 20 companies, but after I went…The afterglow remains for a long time.In the middle of the city of Seoul, I feel like I have been to a flower garden full of fragrance that no one knows.

Seonyu Village Cat Festival will be held by this weekend.The shops in the village become an exhibition space, where people gather with one heart that loves pets.It seems to be Seonyu Village cat axis.Why don't you visit Seonyu Village this weekend and meet the stories of the shops in the flea market and the village?
