Whisker, the maker of Litter-Robot®, announced today an extension of the company's ongoing partnership with Best Friends Animal Society, a leading animal welfare organization working to end the killing of dogs and cats in America's shelters in 2025. Throughout the month of March, every purchase of the Litter-Robot x Best Friends® bundle through Whisker's website will help save cats at Best Friends Animal Society’s lifesaving centers.

About Best Friends Animal Society

For each Best Friends Bundle sold from March 1 through March 31, 2024, Whisker will give back 1% of sales to cover cat adoption fees at Best Friends' lifesaving centers located across the country. As a result of this donation, prospective cat parents looking to adopt through Best Friends will have their adoption fees fully covered throughout the month. By making the path to pet adoption more seamless, Whisker aims to support the animal welfare organization's mission to bring about a time when there are No More Homeless Pets®.

The eligible Best Friends Bundles sold on Litter-Robot.com include:

Litter-Robot 3 Connect Best Friends® Bundle

Litter-Robot 4 Best Friends® Bundle

"We are thrilled to continue helping rescue cats find homes and bringing joy to pets and pet parents with Best Friends," said Whisker President and CEO, Jacob Zuppke.

"Whisker exists to make life with your pet endlessly better, and this partnership makes taking that first step and bringing home your new best friend even easier."

This latest offering builds on a successful partnership established between Whisker and Best Friends in 2023. Last year, Whisker committed and delivered more than $150,000 to the organization in cash and product, helping to save 9,477 cats to date. Whisker also supported shelter volunteers by donating its flagship product, Litter-Robot 4, among other Whisker products to outfit the Best Friends' Cat World Sanctuary and lifesaving centers across the United States. By modernizing the litter box experience and minimizing manual cleanup, volunteers are freed up to spend more time caring for shelter animals and connecting with their communities.

This year, by sponsoring adoptions, Whisker is pleased to continue supporting Best Friends' critical efforts to save the lives of cats and dogs throughout America.

"As Best Friends works intently toward making all U.S. shelters no-kill in 2025, every donation has the potential to enact critical long-term change," said Julie Castle, CEO of Best Friends Animal Society. "We are grateful for our ongoing partnership with Whisker, and the company's most recent pledge to support cat and kitten adoption fees for the entire month of March. For every rescue animal that we place into a loving home, we make progress toward our goal of one day affording every at-risk kitten, cat and dog in America that same positive outcome."

Giving back is core to Whisker's company DNA. Previously, Whisker has worked with organizations including Vista Maria, Michigan Humane Society, The Trevor Project, as well as the brand's local communities in Metro Detroit and Juneau, and beyond.
