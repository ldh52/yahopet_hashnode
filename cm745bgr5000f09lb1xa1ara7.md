Seongnam City announced on December 8 that it is implementing a 'dog insurance subscription support project' to activate the built -in animal registration system and to support the rapid treatment of victims of dog bites.

The target of insurance is 35,115 of the dogs owned by Seongnam citizens.

The insurance period is for one year from November 20 to November 19 next year.

Dogs that are registered during the insurance period are applied individually from the date of approval of the built -in registration.

When a dog is injured, the cost of injuries is guaranteed to the limit of 1 million won per accident and 2 million won per year.

If you have to be liable for compensation due to a accidental accident caused by a dog's actions, you will be paid a premium at 5 million won per accident.

In the case of reasons specified in the guarantee contents, the dog prepares the proof documents and claims directly to the DB Insurance Insurance (â˜Ž02-3471-5109).

Seongnam City introduced this project for the first time this year to strengthen the dogs and the social safety net of citizens.

At the same time, you can register a microchip if you pay 10,000 won at the city animal hospital, which is comparable to the built -in animal registration project.Of the total cost of 30,000 won, 20,000 won is supported by Seongnam City.
