Dogs inspire us to leave our cell phones.As our lives developed more technically, their relationship with dogs also developed.The development of technology provided our best friends with opportunities to give longer and healthier lives and have the opportunity to better understand them.

The development of veterinary medicine leads to a longer and happier life

Thanks to the development of medical technology, veterinary medicine has evolved in the same way as human medicine has evolved.Visiting a veterinarian no longer means vaccination and neutralization.

Kelly Johnson, a veterinarian at the Northstar Vets, New Jersey, has provided several examples of how the development of medical technology has improved their lives and quality of life.“Laparoscopic procedures for pets.In Orthopedic Surgery, the hip joint replacement and cross surgery.Radiation and teams diagnose pets through radiation photos, ultrasound, CT and MRI scans. ”

Most of this technology would not have been provided to veterinarians in the past, and it would be tremendous for most pet guardians, even if it was provided.Experts use these new technologies to develop treatment plans, print bones 3D and support surgical intervention plans.The development of veterinarians to save this life has contributed to reducing dog stress.

“Now the medical team can remotely monitor blood sugar levels at home without having to return to the hospital for several blood collections.We also use continuous blood sugar monitoring that can be read on a smartphone and automatically send to clinic, ”says Melanie Puchot, a veterinarian expert at Northstar Vets.

Wearables add security and early warnings to the dog's health change.

As the activity tracker is common to people, "Pet wearable is an emerging industry where veterinarians and pet families can track health indicators to manage chronic diseases," Johnson says.

These dogs such as Fitbark, Whistle and FI are attached to dog necklaces, and guardians can be updated to how active dogs are for dogs through the mobile app.Over time, this kind of data can help to recognize the decrease in activity, which may be a symptom of disease or pain.The tracker's related apps can compare the dog's level of activity with similar size, age and other dogs of varieties.

The large sales point of the activity tracker technology often includes GPS tracking at a low cost.The dog guardian can connect the device to the home Wi-Fi, and send a push notification to the phone connected every time the dog leaves the area.If a dog uses a connected phone belonging to a guardian, a pet care or a dog walking machine, the information is displayed in the app with the exact location of the dog.

My puppy wears a FITBARK activity tracker with a GPS function.Of course, the GPS tracking can not replace the dog leather straps, and it cannot replace the latest tag necklaces and microchips, but add some security when the dog is lost.You can immediately grasp their position.

Unfortunately, not all wearables are good for dogs.It helps most dogs live safer and healthier, but more products such as shock collar have been spread.In many areas in Europe, the electronic color technology, which has been banned from inhumane, but is designed to cause pain or discomfort, is still used in the United States.

Programming bells and buttons make it easier to communicate with dogs.

Most pet technology helps us learn more about dogs, but some actually help you to learn from dogs.

One of my favorite things to work with a dog as a dog trainer is to learn how to communicate with other species.Thanks to the technology, it became much easier.

Mighty foot smart bells can be installed indoors or outdoors and can be heard anywhere in the house through wireless transmitter.This is a state -of -the -art version that puts on the door to ring when the dog wants to go outside.

Are you looking for more advanced communication with your dog?Inspired by language pathologist Christina Hunger and her companion dog, Stella, the new dog training campaign inspired the field of alternative communication training.Use the recording button programmed as a word that the puppy knows, such as dinner, playing, and walking, and pressing the button before each activity, the dog starts the connection and immediately presses the button itself to communicate.Combining this with some patience, your dog can learn how to convey your needs and needs in a way we can understand.

Cameras and automatic suppliers make your dog safe and happy even if you are far away.

Have you ever wondered what your dog does when you are not at home?Now you can see them!Schuetzner said, “The technology from home is a great tool to see what's going on while the guardian is going out.Most people are wondering what pets are doing all day, so many web -based camera systems can see what's going on and communicate with pets. ”

The Wi-Fi support camera, which can be found on the phone, can be especially useful if you grow a new puppy or support a new rescue dog that adapts to life at home.You can use a dog cam to see if the dog is calm or suffering.It can be especially useful if a dog has anxiety symptoms.What's even better is that you and your dog trainers can see the video and cause a dog (because of the act of leaving or because of what happens while you are left?).

The camera is also useful for supporting older dogs that can begin to experience stress or anxiety when left alone.

The other products are specially designed with their dog guardians.Using Furbo, you can see what your dog is doing, but you can also provide snacks to talk to dogs and provide rewards for calm behavior.Snacking dispensers such as PET Tutor and other automatic suppliers can be used remotely at certain intervals or through the app.Automatic supply also helps to manage pets with a special diet.Puchot said, “Read the microchip of a specific pet and provide an automatic supply that can access the food only the right pets.This completely changes several pet families that require individual prescription foods.

Dogs are not interested in the latest best tools.They want to live at that moment and spend time with us.Whenever we add new technologies to the world of dogs, think about whether it will improve the overall quality of life of the dog.Obviously, products designed to cause pain or inconvenience should be avoided, but the skills that help dogs can live healthier longer or have more fun with dogs.Similarly, if you want as much information as much as possible, if you look at some of these options, you can provide your dog with a happier and healthier life.
