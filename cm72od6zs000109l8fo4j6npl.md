The world's hardware heaven is making a digital leap for pets.In May, Shenzhen, southern China, announced that it should be transplanted to all dogs and joined the ranks of mandatory applying microchips to dogs in the UK, Japan, Australia and more and more countries.

According to social media of Shenzhen Urban Administration Bureau, this week's regulators began to install injection stations at affiliated pet clinic.

The chip, which lasts for more than 15 years of rice, is transplanted under the skin of the dog's neck.If an approved employee scans each chip, the unique 15 digits that match the dog names, varieties, and owners' identity and contact information will help to reduce the departure.The microchip, a wireless frequency identification (RFID) chip, does not track the location of the dog.According to local media reports, the authorities do not store their own personal information.

Shenzhen's leading technology, Huawei, is trying to phased out overseas semiconductor parts due to US trade sanctions, but the city is procuring imported pets, including the United States and Swedish,, according to the same report.

The Shenzhen government is preparing legislation for all implants to strengthen regulatory supervision of the number of pet populations in the city.By November, if the dog is not processed as a microchip, a fine is imposed or a pet should be handed over to the regulatory agency.According to official data, the city, where more than 20 million residents live, owned about 200,000 dogs and cats in 2019.The total number of dogs and cats around the world was almost 1 billion in 2019, an increase of 8.4% year -on -year, the industry white paper said.
