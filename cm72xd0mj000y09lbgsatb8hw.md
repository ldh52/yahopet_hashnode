Exhibition explanation

Combine Series is a series that is produced by combining as its name.It is a work that welded iron metal and non -ferrous metal and designed the combination of heterogeneous metals.

The artist had the idea of ​​making a work by combining non -ferrous metal that had its own color, such as red and brass, with the work of the existing iron metal -oriented work, and studied welding methods that mixed brazing and welding.

While most of the works of the artist's feelings and subjective works, the spirit of minimalism, which constitutes the form using minimal formative means, has been an important factor in constructing the form of his work.

In the form of a simple and masiac overall, we used a polyhedron so that the part where the face meets visually visually.In addition, we focused on proportion and angle to consider the convenience of the user.We designed the curved surface through bending on the metal plate and designed it with a point in the form that could be felt boring.

Combine Series is a work that changes the general metal welding method and suggests a new form of metal furniture to the public.
