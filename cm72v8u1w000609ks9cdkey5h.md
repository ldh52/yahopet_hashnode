All students of Baekbongcho (Principal Shin Bok -ho), Cheongan -myeon, Goesan -gun, held a horse riding experience at Taesan Riding Town in Nangseong -myeon, Cheongju -si from 13th to 16th (Fri).

This activity was carried out to learn how to respect life while interacting with the students and to cultivate the skills of communication and consideration through activities with colleagues.

Students experienced what they would be careful at, riding on each group, hippopotamine, correct posture on horses, how to interact with horses, to walk slowly, and to break up.

In addition to the horse riding experience, I had time to exercise and play with my friends and to communicate and consider.

Principal Shin Bok -ho said, “We have been learning for the first time in the gold school year with Corona 19.”I hope it's a good time. ”

Kwon Soon -ki (3 years) said, “The horse riding experience with my friends was really fun, especially when I was breaking with a horse,” he said.The old people feel amazing how they shot and fights on the horse.I think I can ride better next time. ”

Baekbongcho said that it is difficult to conduct experience learning with Corona 19, but it will find a way to minimize density and practice social distance, and will provide students with a program that respects life, communicates and cares among friends.
