Konkuk University's Global Campus Animal Food Materials, Professor Sang -Ho Moon (Research General), and Professor Yoon Myung -han (Liability for Details) are conducting guidelines for animal welfare livestock livestock livestock facilities.

'Animal Welfare -type Livestock Livestock Facility Research' is an optimal analysis of the behavior and activity characteristics of Korean beef that are raised in the actual farmers for the appropriate ally (10m2 per breeding cow, 7m2, and 2.5㎡ of calf) presented by domestic animal welfare certification.It is a study to present the breeding environment of.

Konkuk University's Global Campus Professor is currently in the country where there are no farms that have been certified as animal welfare in the livestock field, including Korean beef.

The evaluation items are developing an animal welfare certification system that can self -diagnose and evaluate various factors such as △ proper breeding density, △ litter replacement cycle (humidity), △ ventilation, and cowbrush installation.

Professor Moon Sang -ho, a professor of Global Campus, Konkuk University, will compare the density of the breeding density presented by domestic animal welfare certification by presenting proper breeding density.

In addition, this study predicts that animal welfare certification in large livestock can effectively induce certification.

The research of Konkuk University's Global Campus is conducted based on the actual livestock facility environment in two Spring Farms in Icheon City and Shimwoo Farm in Jeungpyeong -gun.

In addition, Chae Seon -se, former head of the Chungbuk Agricultural Research and Technology Institute (Livestock Technology), is conducting a test research with technical advice.
