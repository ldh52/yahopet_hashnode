After reading the book, I really want to say a book.At first I thought it would be easy to read, but it is a book that cannot be read quickly quickly.

'The dogs of the monastery?' In fact, the book title could not be distinguished.I was wondering what it would be, and I thought about it online, and I thought, 'Maybe it's a book about how to train a puppy.'

At the beginning of the book, an ankara of the monastery explains the birth of a dog.Personally, my family has received four pups handmakers.This book shows how young dogs grow from the mysterious moments of childbirth.Looking at the puppies growing, I felt as if I was watching a dog next to it.

The puppy grows bigger and now adopts a new family.This book tells us about what the dogs need to prepare in the new environment and the knowledge needed to live together.It also teaches you how to educate and train these dogs.In fact, the first part of the anka's birth part was easily read like an essay, but the speed of reading is slow in education and training.This part is probably as much as you know, and you understand as much as you know.

Another idea of ​​reading this book is the amazing skills of those who explain their specialty.If you first raise your dog, you will be unfamiliar with new fields, and education and training can be a difficult field.In this book, this book is melted in this book that teaches the principles naturally to those who are first encountered with dogs and learns how to live with dogs.

Personally, I remembered the old memories, and I went to school in the countryside until the second year of middle school, and I transferred to Seoul when I was in the third year of middle school.When I was in a country school, the subject of science was really young.Most of them had to memorize, and if they couldn't memorize it at the time, they were not usually confused by the teacher.But somehow, I transferred to Seoul, so science became a really easy subject.The teacher really explained the principle so easily and casually.It was something that I didn't have to memorize it even if I tried to memorize it.

“Was science so fun?” It is what the countryside who just went to the countryside said.

As I read this book, I felt the feelings I felt again in my third year of middle school.

Since elementary school, I have been educated in memorization, and it seems that I have been educated to solve only that part to solve any problem.To solve the problem, he had to memorize the formula and assign it to the problem.The same is true to apply this to our pet field.

Dog training, animal mediation therapy, animal communication, behavioral correction, organic animals…As the pet culture developed, the activities of clubs and civic groups in each field became active.Those who have not been able to get to know pets like me do not see a large forest, but only see the stimuli and superficial appearance seen in reality.This is a problem today that most companions are experiencing not only me.I see a lot of information and information on TV or the Internet, but I am trying to understand only my head as we were concerned about the difficult formulas of science when we were in school.I don't have to memorize it.If you understand and listen very easily and fun, you can remember it for a long time and don't have to remember your head.

Foreign education does not seem to be.You can see that by looking at this book, the Puppy of the Newsket Monastery.This book contains so many things.I also think that I can share this book and write a few books.You may be on the theme of the growth and socialization of dogs, or as one of the education and training of dogs.I think it can be divided into at least three books.

I often used to read foreign applications while attending college, but I seemed to have sent admiration while looking at the book.Unlike domestic books that are trying to explain so hard, I saw a lot of explanations in the application very easily.I think it would be faster if this book was read as an application.

It's hot summer.Unlike the books I read earlier, this book could not be read quickly.The monks of the newskit who have built their own know -how in one field.It is easy to explain, but it was not so easy to read.The translator says that the training method of the newskit is not entirely right.

I don't know if there is a monastery like a newskit in Korea.Perhaps in our country, the temples in the mountains and the native of the mountains are the American monastery.I think, 'Why don't you grow a puppy in our country?'Wouldn't it be recognized worldwide if you settle a systematic dog breeding method like a newskit monastery?

Finally, the cover of the black and white photographs strolling with three Sepfords is not the past but also in the present.The website of the newskit monastery is https://newskete.org/.You can actually meet the monastery and dog in the book online.

I didn't like to read and read, but as I have been with books in recent weeks, I feel that reading is pretty cool.Yesterday, the heat of the early summer of the year was on the rise, and after a long time, I forgot my time and forgot the heat and read the book.It seems to be more fun to read than the early weekend soccer.

In a hot summer, it seems to be a good way to spend the summer with a book.
