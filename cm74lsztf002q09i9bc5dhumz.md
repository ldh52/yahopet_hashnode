The feet of our children have not developed suitable for our lives.Foot hair and toenails do not fit well for usual artificial floor materials.

​

To protect the shock from the floor, it looks suitable for walking or running well in various environments such as soil, stones, sand, and trees.In particular, cats evolved so that they could walk without sounding to approach food without sound.

But on a slippery floor, this original physical structure doesn't go well, and even this causes disease.

​

It's too small to walk around, and it's hard to walk around.There is something I don't want to think so much about pets.For small or medium -sized children, it also develops at a large rate.

According to the data of Japanese pet housing research, more than 60%of the dogs have joint diseases before the age of six, and 70%of the causes of joint disease are related to slippery floor.In addition, about 20%of the dogs are found to have a patella dislocation.

As a countermeasure, you need to choose an anti -slip flooring material.

​

In a house with a pet, I think about various things when choosing a flooring material.Among them, polishing tiles are also installed as a whole to facilitate cleaning.

​

Of course, polishing tile ingredients are good to see, and even if you make a mistake, it is very good to clean.However, it is slippery for the gorgeous aesthetics, so it is never suitable for our children.

​

Introducing measures to prevent slipping.

1. Dedicated matte

It is already used in Japan, which is already ahead of pet housing.

It feels like a cushioning feeling and a walking in the soil, and it is a structure that can be washed separately when contaminated.There is no yet in our country.In some cases, there are cases where they are imported and constructed, but they cost a lot.

2. Anti -slip floor (river floor)

Although it is a domestic SME, there is a company that developed anti -slip rape with its own technology.

Foreign products, which are already advanced in pet culture, are not priced due to imports.But for a few years ago, there have been companies that have developed and produced these technologies in our country.

3. Thick plates

As a domestic product, there are products with a thickness of 4.5t / 6t or more.

These products have a sense of cushion and the surface is coated with eco -friendly materials, so it is not too hard for our children to live.In addition, the blanket can be treated safely even if you make a mistake on the floor due to the waterproof effect.

4. Anti -slip coating

It is to make an anti -slip coating on the existing wooden floor.

This has the advantage of being able to construct various floor materials by constructing a coating solution in existing floor materials.

5. Mat installation

In most homes, it is a method of purchasing a separate flooring material on the existing floor and making it on the floor.

This is the most efficient way you can do in a home already constructed.However, since it is not constructed from the beginning, there is no choice but to be installed.Rather, if you walk along the slippery floor and the slippery floor, you can overwhelm the knees.

4. Non -slip tile

There is a non -slip tile that prevents slippery in the tile.Normally, it is not a smooth tile.In the case of tiles, it is somewhat burdensome to construct in the living room or bedroom.That's why most of them are constructed only in pet rooms, toilets, and balconies.

​

This is a way to protect our children's patellar and to be a comfortable floor to be a comfortable floor, not a dangerous floor.
