The French Bulldog reigns supreme! The American Kennel Club (AKC®), a not-for-profit organization, the world's largest purebred dog registry and leading advocate for dogs, announced this morning that the playful and adaptable French Bulldog is America's most popular breed for the second consecutive year, according to AKC registration statistics.

Since overtaking the loveable Labrador Retriever as the most popular breed, the French Bulldog's popularity has continued to surge. The breed is playful, adaptable and has an even temperament. Frenchies are very popular among city dwellers, as they're also portable and get along with almost anyone.

"The French Bulldog's surge in popularity shows no signs of slowing down," said AKC Executive Secretary Gina DiNardo. "Their long list of fabulous traits makes them wonderful companions for a variety of people, but that doesn't mean they're for everyone. It's extremely important to do your research to not only find the right breed for your lifestyle, but to ensure that you're getting a well-bred dog from a responsible breeder."

Making a comeback is the Dachshund, working its way up the top 10 (#9 in 2022 to #6 in 2023). Other breeds making moves in 2023 include the Papillon (#51 in 2022 to #45 in 2023), Great Pyrenees (#69 in 2022 to #64 in 2023), Basenji (#91 in 2022 to #81 in 2023) and Finnish Lapphund (#167 in 2022 to #135 in 2023).

Making strides over the past decade are the Cane Corso (#51 in 2013 and #16 in 2023), the Belgian Malinois (#61 in 2013 and #33 in 2023), the Giant Schnauzer (#84 in 2013 and #56 in 2023) and the Russell Terrier (#103 in 2023 and #66 in 2023).
