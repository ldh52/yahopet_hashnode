On December 29, 19 (Sun), Jindo Power's first bazaar, Jindo Actually, was held at the Pyeongtaek Dog Cafe Opening.Jindol Power is a solidarity for Jindo, Mix, and Native Dogs, starting with the first meeting on March 9, and has been a total of nine regular meetings and three volunteer activities.

After hearing the news that Jindol's Bazaar 'Jindo Actually' is held, he went to Pyeongtaek Dog Cafe.In this article, we sketch the gathering of people who love dogs and news of the bazaar scene.

When I arrived at the opening, I opened the door, and the Jindo Actually Bazaar was in progress.I tried to explore the goods on the bazaar, and the dogs who jumped outdoors caught the eye.'White Yak' and 'Spring Spring', which prepared for the event, went out with the dogs.

The slender body's dogs are so exciting ... I take a picture in the picture.

Slender dogs run vigorously ... It is a spectacular view of the blue floor.

Even if you go to a dog cafe or playground, Jindol Power's Power is often not able to enter just because of Jindo dog.So Jindol's power aims to create a dog culture without discrimination.

When asked about the power gathering of Jindol, "Jindol Power is currently working around the metropolitan area and Jeolla -do branches, and there are two branches, such as a regular meeting that pays the participation fee by renting a specific place.If we only have a basic pet ticket, we have no special restrictions on our meetings.

I looked around the outdoor playground and looked back on the bazaar that was being carried out inside the cafe.You can see the dogs who are welcoming indoors.

Pyeongtaek Dog Café, where Jindo Actually is being held ... Cafe's representative was also a love for Jindo dogs and organic animals.

"Originally, I had a blessing, and I adopted a ding to make a friend, and I adopted the Great Pyrenizes 'Moka' at the organic animal shelter where you visited to adopt a small dog.We were adopted just before we were born in a dog factory and were adopted. "And to live with dogs, he opened a dog cafe here.

At a dog cafe in Pyeongtaek, Jindol's Power Bazaar was held to create a companion culture without discrimination.Jindo dogs ... and large dogs are scary and terrible people who try to break the prejudice of people, Jindol Power ...

I also remember saying, "Jindo dogs are ferocious, so if you meet Jindo dogs, you shouldn't look upright."Therefore, it was true that when I met Jindo dogs, I slowed down at least once.But the dogs I met at the bazaar today were not at all.

Excitingly running through the spacious playground ... The people who see it are 'Yes,' and everyone seems to hit your knees.Our traditional dog Jindo dogs, the Jindo, the mix, and the native dogs that we have always been together around us ... Isn't it the best dogs with our Koreans?

It is said that there are not many places to go to the longest dogs with us.Therefore, it is said that 'Jindol Power' was born to meet with native dogs and to volunteer.

Jindol power!We sympathize with the purpose of the meeting for our native dogs and expect great activities in the future.

It's winter, so the outside gets dark.Haha, it's time to return home with the warm atmosphere of the cute Jindo Actually.The proceeds from the bazaar are said to be donated to the shelter in desperate need.
