Ventilation devices are devices that keep the air flow in the room and outdoor to keep the air clean.Nowadays, in addition to circulating clean external air, it also functions to prevent external contaminated air such as fine dust and external contaminants in indoor contaminants such as carbon dioxide, radon, and other pollutants.

Ventilation facilities have the most basic windows and doors.In the multi -city apartments, there are only basic windows.As a result, we install additional additional ventilation devices.

Let's take a look at why a dedicated ventilation device is needed in a house with pets.​

First, pet protection.

While our children are alone in the house, the guardian will open the window a bit for ventilation.However, children who are more sensitive to hearing and olfactory people respond to external stimuli through open windows.You may be stressed because of this stimulus, you may be barked, threatened, and shows abnormal behavior.

​

In particular, cats have the characteristics of 'high -up syndrome'.

In our words, it is called the acupuncture muscle, and through the open windows, we talk about the habits of two or more floors and even jumping on the roof.No matter how high the cat runs well, but in this case, the fracture and damage to the internal organs will occur.Beyond injury to death.

This cause is not known exactly, but it is commonly known as curiosity.There is also a foreign proverb called curiosty killed the cat. (Curiosity kills a cat).In addition, in the case of cats, a separate safety device is required.​

Second, the health of the guardian.

There is a unique smell in a house where pets are raised.

No matter how cleaned, the pet smells because it has a habit of indicating its realm in smell.However, you can't open the door every day and ventilate.Such an environment is not good for guardians and pets, and in severe cases, respiratory or allergic diseases may cause ventilation, so it requires particularly ventilation or requires a separate ventilation device.

​

Third, civil complaints for neighbors.

The barking sounds through the windows opened for ventilation can cause complaints to the neighboring neighbors.

No matter how good the soundproofing device is, there will be complaints around the window.Because of these reasons, ventilation should be considered.

There are a lot of products for these ventilation.From products that are simply installed in existing houses to how to create ventilation systems throughout the house.

Ventilation is essential to humans and pets.Each product introduced has its advantages and disadvantages.Some products are installed in existing houses, but the best thing is built-in when building a house.

We will create a residential space with pets.
