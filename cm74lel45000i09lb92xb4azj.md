I am in my 40s who have lived in Japan for many years and have lived with three dogs.I would like to look back on my experience in Japan and reflect on how the culture was.

Japan is a country that is not easy to live with dogs.It is more accurate than that, rather than that, 'not just a family member from the beginning'.Normally, countries that are recognized as a pet awareness are not much noticed about Japan, which is close to Europe, which is the leader of Germany.

I wanted to raise a dog in Japan, but I was not satisfied with the environmental conditions.When I felt healing sometimes in a difficult Japanese life, I went to a pet shop all over the place and made a lot of data.

To summarize the pet culture in Japan

First, it is a high sale price.

Japan also has a pet shop in a large mart.The puppies you meet here are also mainly small dogs.

In Japan, there are many houses with small houses and single -family homes and courtyards, not in the city, but it is difficult if the economic power is not supported to some extent.

In terms of price, small dogs are higher than large dogs.

In the case of large dogs, most of them are about 15-250 yen and usually show 200,000 yen around 200,000 yen.In the case of small dogs, it was basically more than 200,000 yen.Especially in the case of the popular mother -in -law, the prices were nearly 400,000 yen, and the preferred Toy Puil, which was preferred in Korea, also shows a pretty price of more than 1 million yen.Even in the case of mix dogs, 7-80,000 yen is set and the pre-sale price of 5-7 or 8 months, which missed the sale time, has about 100,000 yen.

That's why you need enough thoughts to adopt.Then, like Korea, it may not occur frequently, such as a gift, and accepted by someone as a gift.

Second is a tricky procedure for adoptees' conditions.

Looking at the envy for a long time, you can see the story between people and employees who want to be sold once.In that case, bring a huge amount of documents to sign and check each other.

Sit at the table for more than 30 minutes, talk and exchange information.Briefing on information about dogs and how to grow them is simply delivered.

The most important thing is that it does not end in the documents, and all members of the family to be sold come together to check.If anyone opposes it, it probably does not allow the sale to the shop (at least all of the places I've been to).

Third is the condition of the living environment.

In the case of the mansion (the same as the apartment in our country, but the high -rise or various buildings do not form a colony, but the universal Japanese residence system, which is a medium concept between the villa and the apartment), does not allow pets.

Finding a mansion where pets permits is a star of the sky, and if you break it, nine are evicted in ten.In addition, even if it is raised, it should be a story with the residents' understanding and the management company and the real estate side.

Fourth is a mandatory walk.

As you walk on the street, you will see a stroll with a dog that looks uncomfortable with the old man's behavior that looks uncomfortable while pushing a stroller or a brace to barely lean on.

In Japan, walking is obligations.In fact, most of them have been looking for their parents in Japan, and most of them have been unable to walk dogs due to the death of the dogs, illnesses or accidents.

I felt great in the form of a walkâ€¦No puppy was barked, rushing, or anxious.Like a long habit, I became part of my life, and I could feel that appropriate socialization and education were fully before it.

In addition, most people were wearing bottled water on their side.It is not uncommon to pour water even as well as stools.

Those who are pretty who are pretty in dogs do not call or touch dogs.Not only do they seek in advance, but most of them pass by with the eyes.This is an etiquette.

Fifth is a mandatory purp -training for large dogs.

In order to welcome large dogs as a dog, education for socialization is conducted from a certain period of time.This is involved with dogs and dogs.Dogs and dogs who have completed this perfy training are given a certificate, which proves that this dog can hang out with other dogs and others.(There are differences by region)

Isn't it quite basic conditions?!

After these basic literacy is equipped, I think it is necessary to expand the cultural contents that can be with pets.

Isn't it right to ask society to share it with pets after earning the basic consciousness of the dogs rather than the sound of a ball man about the perception of living with a dog?
