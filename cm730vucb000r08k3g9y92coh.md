Nowadays, as the time spent in the house increases in 19 coronas, the craving for nature grows.The uncertainty of the future, the prolonged Corona 19, which will not end, and the depression caused by a big change in everyday life, and the southern island forest, which is colorfully colored by those who experience 'Corona Blue', remove deep depression in the heart.

Nami Island will spray dozens of tons of ginkgo leaves from Songpa -gu, Seoul on November 11th on the island's central “Songpa Ginkgo Tree Road” to present another fall to tourists.The roads scattered evenly with fluffy ginkgo leaves are about 100 m from central plaza to villa.In the Songpa Ginkgo Road, everyone falls into concentricity.

So why did the ginkgo leaves come from Songpa -gu on Nami Island Songpa Ginkgo?

It is natural to lose leaves when cold wind blows.But Nami Island was different.This is because the crossover is large and the leaves fall faster than other regions.So Nami Island thought.'Wouldn't it be difficult to kill ginkgo leaves in Songpa -gu, Seoul?In 2006, the first steps on Nami Island were assimilated with Nami Island.

This year, in addition to ginkgo leaves, 200 tons of fallen leaves collected from Songpa -gu were collected and delivered to Banghari farms in Namsan -myeon, Chuncheon -si.

In addition, Nami Island has a forest path where you can see various autumn leaves that attract tourists.

Next to Songpa Ginkgo Road is a metasequoia road, widely known as word of mouth.The metasequoia road is not only colored in the autumn, but also the autumn color with the sunshine, and the autumn color creates a mysterious atmosphere in the photo.

The riverside promenade, located on the west side of the island, is colored in late autumn maple leaves.When various leaves blend with the green river, the green leaves and five -colored autumn leaves are more exciting.

The ginkgo tree road along the village village, located along the southwestern river of Nami Island, can enjoy the taste of the Bukhan River along the deck road.Late in the afternoon, the sun shines more beautifully in the sunshine.Lee Gil's name is 'Riverside Lover Ginkgo Wood Road', which literally is the most popular autumnal course for lovers.

Hotel Jeonggwan -ru Coffee Shop, famous for its illustration art hotel, is a hidden secret garden of Nami Island, and is a hidden secret garden of Nami Island.It is a good place.

Nature is a big fence of life that we must belong to in the Corona era.I feel more desperate as I live in the Corona era that the life of living in the four seasons is blessed by itself.Don't miss the late autumn of Nami Island, where tens of thousands of trees are colored before it is too late.

On the other hand, the way to go to Nami Island, where the maple leaves are ripening and the mood, can be searched for 1024 in the Bukhan Riverside of Gapyeong -eup, Gapyeong -gun, Gyeonggi -do, or the Nami Island ticket office/Nami Island dock in the name search.When using the public transportation, the train station (train) and the bus terminal, which are the closest to Nami Island, are Gapyeong Station (Gyeongchun Line) and Gapyeong Intercity Bus Terminal, and both are 2km away.
