In December 2015, Naruko's Meow's Newspaper was debuted in the world.After five years, the Meow Newspaper is now about to publish No. 60.

'Cat news has been leading Korean cat culture for the past five years, as there is a cat news in Goyang -daero, Goyang -daero!

If you are a cat deacon ... Online, the cat news will have been heard about various cats through the newspaper.And the emotions of Park Sang -wook, who are dissolved in two media, would have met.

Isn't this friendlyness of Park Sang -wook, who always shows a hairy smile like a uncle next door, and Park, who captivates the public?The everyday life of Park through Facebook makes us look back at the beauty of everyday life we ​​haven't found.

The newspaper that decorates the first page with the works of cat -related newspapers and cat writers every month ... Meow newspapers are their own conceptual concepts with the love of cat deacons.

In the office of Naruko, like a small exhibition, we could meet the cute cat goods as much as the cover of the newspaper.

Park's power, which has written a lot of books, is hiding, and the history of cat culture in Korea.

It was a pleasure and warmth I felt at Naruko on the first floor of Haengsin Station on the road of winter, where it was likely to be welcomed by the cold wind.
