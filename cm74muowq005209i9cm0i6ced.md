The Ministry of Environment (Minister Kwang-rae) established the 1st Zoo Management Plan (2021-2025), which includes systematic management of 110 zoos (20 public and 90 private sectors) nationwide, and January 1, next year.It will be implemented.This comprehensive plan is in accordance with the Act on the Management of Zoo and Aquarium (hereinafter referred to as Zoo Aquarium Act).It is the first legal plan prepared after the law was revised.In order to establish a comprehensive plan, the Ministry of Environment has passed the opinions of external experts, held public hearings for stakeholders for animal and operators, and consulted with the ministry (October) and the 'Zoo and Aquarium Animal Management Committee' (November).The comprehensive plan is a vision of 'zoo for both people and animals' as a vision, ① securing animal welfare and habitat environment, ② securing public safety and health, ③ building biodiversity preservation and research foundation, ④ Establishing a cooperative system at home and abroad, ⑤ zoo advancementIt consists of five strategies and 13 major tasks, including the foundation.

① Conversion of the zoo permit system and the wildlife café, etc., the 'Zoo Aquarium Government' will be revised to convert the current zoo registration system to the permit system and introduce a professional inspection control.※ The establishment of the current zoo is equipped with offices, exhibitions and breeding facilities.If a possible permit system is introduced, the type of wild animals that can be displayed according to the breeding environment will be limited, such as the breeding environment, such as the breeding environment only in the zoo with an outdoor radiation site from 2022.※ Currently, there is no specific standard for animal habitat space, so you can display beasts such as tigers and lions indoors.Specifically, a professional inspectors can check whether the species and breeding facilities are appropriate.In addition, animal bells*that need to be specially protected and managed are selected to prepare separate management guidelines and strengthen legal management personnel requirements such as breeders.*Existing zoos such as orangutan, chimpanzee, elephant, bear, lion, and tiger are required to improve the animal habitat in line with the facility standards that will be strengthened in 2022 (Enforcement Act).Diagnosing levels qualitatively and quantitatively to gradually improve poor aging facilities through sequential support.Due to concerns about the acquisition common infectious diseases caused by Corona 19, the company prohibits exhibitions under the size of the zoo, such as wild animal cafes.※ As of December20, the Ministry of Environment, the Ministry of Environment, will identify the exact status of wild animals displayed in facilities that are not registered as zoos and aquariums throughout the country until June next year.It also checks the acquisition of international endangered species on display in wild animal cafes.In addition, it is prohibited from exhibiting mobile animals that greatly limit animal experiences such as feeding and touching animal welfare and bringing animals to kindergarten.In order to prevent ecosystem disturbances caused by foreign species left by organic or ownership, foreign organic wildlife shelters will be installed at the National Ecological Center and Public Zoo, and will be designed from next year.

② The system for all life health care from the introduction of wild animals to the death of all life health management.To this end, the basic principles and step -by -step and situations are prepared by the 'Disease and Public Health Management Guidelines **', which contains the tips for measures.*(Step -by -step) Animal introduction (export and entry permit, quarantine) → exhibition and breeding → death (by situation) Simple diseases, animal infectious diseases, and common infectious diseases ** Public health and animal disease management guidelines, acquisition common infectious diseases managementIn the event of wildlife livestock infectious diseases (avian influenza, etc.) and common infectious diseases at the guideline zoo, mandatory to inform the health and management authorities*from the stage of occurrence.*The Zoo Safety Management Regulations are prepared to prevent disasters such as the Ministry of Environment (National Wildlife Disease Management Service, the Regional Basin Environmental Office), the Disease Management Headquarters, the Agriculture, Forestry and Livestock Quarantine Headquarters, and local governments to prevent disasters and to respond quickly in case of accidents.In addition, periodic simulation training is also conducted.

③ Reinforcement of the zoo's preservation, research, and educational function as a role reinforcement of biodiversity preservation, research, and educational institution.In preparation for biological extinction, we will discover various forms of conservation and proliferation research programs through collaboration with related organizations*, and establish a research council to perform it.*National (Nakdong River, Honam) Biological Resources Center, National Park Management Corporation, National Ecology Center, University Research Institute, Facilities Preservation Institute, Biological Resources Conservation facilities, etc.

In addition, the number of zoos designated as an out -of -style preservation institution will be expanded from three to six by 2025, and reviewing various biological resources owned by the zoo, and expanding the species of the current 24 species.

Since 2024, we will hold research and educational performance presentations every year, and we will strengthen support through evaluation.Using the living wildlife*owned by the zoo, we will develop on -site experience curriculum for natural ecology and environmental conservation.*In connection with the Ministry of Education by 2023, such as wild animals, endangered species, etc..

④ Animal breeding, water history computerization and sharing 'Zoo Information Management System' is established to computerize the breeding and number of information such as the animal's biometric information.Once the system is established, it will be linked with the World Zoo Information Management System (ZIMS*), which is recognized as an international standard in major zoos from 96 countries around the world, including the European Union (EU), the United States, and India.※ The World Zoo Information Management System (*ZOOLOGICAL INFORMATION Management System, Special 360.org): 22,000 animal species, more than 10 million individuals are listed and managed, and more than 82 million cases of water and prevention information, breeding management information of 220 millionIt is listed, and in Korea, the Gwacheon Seoul Zoo and two Everlands are members of the 'Zoo Information Management System' in the 'Zoo Information Management System', the main wildlife*, the lineage and biometric information (genetic information, etc.)Veterinary treatment records, breeding and management records, and previous life transfer information (birth -deposition) will be recorded.*Domestic endangered species with high preservation value (tiger, leopard, styra, otter, otter, etc.)

⑤ Breeding cooperation programs will be established for major species*to strengthen domestic and foreign cooperation, to adjust the number of populations and to promote genetic diversity by preventing breeding prevention and prevention of breeding.*Tiger, Hyena, cheetah, zebra, elephant, and apes, the Ministry of Environment, organized an animal breeding and exchange council under the Ministry of Environment, to begin research on major foreign species that require special protection such as international endangered species and beasts.This study reduces the number of outpatient wildlife populations imported from overseas, and improves domestic zoo breeding environment and animal welfare.In order to lead and spread the zoo innovation, the nation will be divided into four areas: the metropolitan area, Gangwon, Chungcheong, Honam, Jeju, and Yeongnam area.Innovation base centers in the vocabulary zoo will be installed, and small and small zoos shared expertise accumulated in the entire zoo operation in the region, such as breeding and disease management techniques, and conduct joint research and professional education functions.*Promotion of professional operation and management techniques, co -preservation and research in the area, support for disease management and quarantine, development of preservation and breeding cooperation programs, university student internship education, general ecological education, etc.~ '25) Establishment of the center, ('24 ~) Operation (operating expenses support) Finally, the International Zoo Organization*, Citizens' Organization, and the government will establish and accumulate cooperation system between the international zoo organization*, civic groups, and governments to respond to problems such as global biodiversity reduction and declineBy sharing the results of the research, it will improve the research capacity and activate the domestic endangered species restoration project.*World Zoo Association (WAZA), Eurasian Animal Aquarium Association (EAZA), Southeast Asian Zoo Aquarium Association (SEAZA) ** Operating a program to strengthen the capacity of Russia (tiger, half breast bear, etc.) when securing unique species on the Korean peninsulaIn addition, the company will actively introduce advanced programs for domestic zoo policies by actively introducing overseas best practices through invitation to international experts and participation in international events.

Park Yeon -jae, the Ministry of Environment, said, “This comprehensive plan has led to an opportunity to improve the welfare of the exhibition animal welfare and habitat environment.”I said.
