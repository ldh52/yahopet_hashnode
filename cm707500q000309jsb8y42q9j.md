VetChip was selected as the grand prize winner of the 2024 Pet Care Innovation Prize, earning $25,000 and support from the pet care experts at Purina. VetChip was one of five pet care startups from across the U.S., Canada, and Australia that pitched their businesses to pet industry influencers and investors at Global Pet Expo, the pet care industry's biggest trade show. The biotechnology company is dedicated to improving animal health and welfare through pioneering technology that monitors, analyzes, and detects pet health issues. The VetChip is implanted to gather data and alert pet owners via an app if potential issues or signs of illness or injury are detected, allowing for faster diagnosis and treatment.

"We are absolutely thrilled to have our revolutionary biosensor achievements recognized through the Pet Care Innovation Prize 2024," said VetChip co-founder Garnett Hall, DVM. "This award will help us to unlock a world of possibilities for proactive animal healthcare, including welfare monitoring, nutrition support and detection of diseases. The time spent with the team at Purina has been extremely rewarding and will help immensely to accelerate our R&D efforts."

VetChip was selected by a panel of judges that included investors, industry experts, and Purina executives. In January, five startups were selected from nearly 150 companies to participate in the 2024 class for the Pet Care innovation Prize. Each winner received $25,000 cash and participated in a bootcamp accelerator experience with business experts, industry leaders, veterinarians, and Purina executives to broaden their network, strengthen their business plan, and gain knowledge from across the pet care landscape. The 2024 class of Pet Care Innovation Prize winners represents some of the best innovation happening in the $136.8 billion* pet care industry.

The Pet Care Innovation Prize is a highlight for all of us at Purina, allowing us to help grow the entrepreneurial petcare network, and bring more solutions to the industry that improve the lives of pets and their owners," said Bill Broun, co-lead of Purina's 9 Square Ventures division and Vice President Mergers & Acquisitions and Corporate Venturing at Purina.
