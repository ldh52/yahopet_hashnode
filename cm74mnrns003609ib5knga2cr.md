On July 27 (Sat) ~ 28 (Sun), the Pet Milly Festival was held in AK & Hongdae.At the festival, sellers selling various products participated in the event, and we met the 3D printer company 'Pick'.

Picks use their own 3D scanners to scan pets and produce them as figures.The 3D scanner consists of 115 cameras, which can be scanned within 2 seconds using 3D scanners.Just as people draw a circle when they play Ganggangsa, 3D scanners are also rounded around the targets, so they are automatically scanned when their companions and pets are inside.

When making 3D Picure, guests can visit the studio and take them, or can be produced by the pictures sent to the picks.It takes about 7 days from 3D scan to figures.

Picks are not only 3D figures, but also have a sticker that can be attached to the vehicle, key ring, and cell phone case.
