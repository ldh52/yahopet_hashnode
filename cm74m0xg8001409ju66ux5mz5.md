Goyang Starfield, which would have been visited by a companion.As you heard, you can meet a lot of companions shopping with your dog in Starfield. Most of the people who go on a collar, they can be put on a stroller or who are holding them.It seems to be helpful for health.Head to Molly Pet Shop on the left side of Starfield.

Goyang Starfield is not unfamiliar with a companion and a dog.

In the early days of the opening, I heard that there are people who don't keep pet tickets.

The area with a restaurant has not yet entered with a dog.Looking at the search, Pyongyang Myeonok is said to be accompanied by a dog.I did it.

Although there are businesses where dogs can enter and exit on the floor, it may be possible to go with a dog with a dog.I think everyone will be able to get a nice space with a nice pet ticket.
