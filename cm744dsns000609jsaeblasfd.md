Lee Ji -yeon introduced three papers that were the background of the theme selection in October, and each paper was a paper that looked at the “Sori slaughter as a sintering nuclear measure” in each norm.After the introduction of the three papers, Lee Ji -yeon conducted a discussion with the participants and discussions with the participants on how to see the 'Wild boar slaughter as an ASF countermeasure'.

The three related papers are as follows.

1. Bovine Tuberculosis and Badger Culling in England: An Animal Rights-Based Analysis of Policy Options, Steven P. McCulloch · Michael J. Reis (31 July 2017)

2. Bovine Tuberculosis and Badger Culling in England: A Utilitarian Analysis of Policy Options, Steven P. McCulloch · Michael J. Reiss (30 July 2017)

3. ovine Tuberculosis Policy in England: Would a Virtuous Government Cull Mr Badger?, Steven P. McCulloch · Michael J. Reiss2 (31 July 2017)

Each paper contains the British sintering and bad -related slaughter, which shows that the finding of badgings to prevent sintering is not effective.The interesting thing about the paper is that the badgings, which were loved by the British people, are in the same time as the slaughter time, and the image changes.Even now, the British people love badgers, but the government is slaughtered to prevent the expansion of viruses, such as sintering nucleus.

Let's take a look at the discussion of the seminar on this day.

In the United States, people who work and study in the National Ecological Park include not only technical personnel but also historians.Considering the areas in the area and how it influenced the environment, we manage ecological parks.In Korea, environmentalists, ecological scholars, and technicians, as well as historians, and humanities should be able to participate in this field.

In the case of ASF, civil democratic systems were not built in determining killing.This system should be built, and decision -making should be made by the correct process.

Although there is a difference in the problems of factory livestock, there is a difference in perspectives and behavioralization by animal rights groups, but it is necessary to try to solve this problem.

Representative Lee Ji -yeon explains the slaughter of wild boar from an individualist point of view.
