Gyeonggi -do announced on the 13th that the first online pet life respect education, which was held at the Dow Dog Sharing Center in Gyeonggi -do, was successful.

'Pet Life Respect Education' is a guardian-dog quantum education program that has been regularly conducted at the Dow Dog Sharing Center in Gyeonggi-do since 2018.

Experts in each field of knowledge that dog guardians need to know, such as training, health care, beauty, and nutrition, directly inform them.It is known for its high satisfaction and education effect by aiming for small practical training.

In particular, from September to December this year, the company decided to introduce an online non -face -to -face method according to the social distance guidelines to prevent the spread of Corona 19.

Initially, the center had a lot of concerns about how to practice and immediate communication, which were the advantages of this education.But this was a tilt.As the education began, it was more active than ever in the high interest of the participants.

In fact, the educational participants practiced with the dogs in accordance with the video lectures in real time, and actively communicated with the instructors by using the chat window to answer questions about questions.

In particular, there was no problem with the constraints of class space, which is the disadvantage of face -to -face education, so more participants were able to participate in education than before.In the past, more than half of the applicants did not participate in the training due to the narrow problem in the center.

In addition, in order to participate in the education, there was a trouble to come to the Dough Dog Sharing Center in Mado -myeon, Hwaseong -si, but it was also well received that it was possible to participate in education at home without any inconvenience in the introduction of online non -face -to -face education methods.

Kim Hyun -chul, head of the Gyeonggi -do Dow Sharing Center, said, “We will actively contribute to the establishment of mature pet culture and the need for the desire for dogs by developing and providing various and effective online educational contents.”
