When I visited the Osu Campground, it was a video of a racing park next to the Park.I visited Ohsu in line with the Festival of Osu, and I was able to see racing practicing at the Gray Hound Club.

Gongdog…Dogs' run races, there is no dog in our country yet.The most active country is Australia, which is very active like racing, and the public is also popular.However, because of the poor environment of overcoming dogs participating in the dog, many people are the object of scolding.

Breeds such as Gray Hound and Italian Gray Hound, who are born with a rush instinct, will need a space to run endlessly, but use it to participate in a commercial race to overuse the body and throw away a dog that is not worth it as a race dog.Because of this, many oppose their dogs.Overpayment…In order for the correct dog culture to root out, if the management of these race dogs becomes transparent, and the happy life of these race dogs is guaranteed, I think someday, the dogs that the Gray Hounds will run will be active in Korea.
