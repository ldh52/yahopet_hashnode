Cheongju Land Management Office Cheongju Zoo announced on the 6th that it will operate an animal class on the top 10 (Tuesday) and 24th of the upcoming winter.

The first animal classroom this year will be operated by the minimum number of people, which are the first people to maintain the indoor safety distance due to the 19 -long change of Corona.

Under the theme of “Warm Winter of Animals,” we will invite professional instructors to prepare for winter -specific winter and ecological characteristics.

In addition, the company plans to observe the characteristics of the zoo animals with the zookeepers and to provide children's direct experience to warm the animal history by using the neck.

An official from Cheongju City Zoo said, "I do not educate a lot of people because of Corona 19, but I hope it will be an opportunity to give good memories to the participating children and understand the winter life of animals."

Participants in the animal class can enter and take free of charge. For more information, please contact the Cheongju Land Management Zoo (043-201-4883).
