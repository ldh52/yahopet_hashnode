Cheonan is actively promoting the long cat's neutralization (TNR) project for urban ecosystem where humans and animals coexist.Neutralization Project TNR is an abbreviation for capture trap, neutralization surgery NEUTER, and radiation Return.It is a project to conduct neutralization surgery as a target.The city conducted a neutralization (TNR) project for 708 long cats until last year, and in the first half of this year, 515 neutralization surgery was completed as the number of long cats related to long cats increased.In the second half of this year, the company plans to neutralize more than 400 animals in cooperation with animal protection organizations and animal protection animal hospitals by November 30.The city is conducting a project for housing dense areas first and will perform surgery in the ordered order when receiving the report.If you need neutralization surgery, you can apply for a wired at the Cheonan City Hall (041-521-5734).Neutralized cats can be easily distinguished from long cats that have not been neutralized because they cut the left ear end of the left ear during surgery.A city official said, “In order to secure both animal life and civil safety, more than 70% of each cluster is neutralized, and the city is harmoniously coexisting until the number of long cats decreases due to the reduction of long cats from outside.We ask for the active participation of citizens. ”
