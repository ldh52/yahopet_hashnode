The Cultural Heritage Administration (Chung Jae -sook) has established a system to preserve the distribution of livestock -free genetic resources designated as a natural monument, and preserved a distribution system in the National Livestock National Livestock Institute of Livestock, Gyeongnam, and the Jeju Special Self -Governing Province, respectively.Freeze genetic resources are resources that freeze animals, eggs, eggs, fertilized eggs, and somatic cells, and soak them in liquid nitrogen at minus 196 degrees (Â° C.) and make them permanently preserved.Conservation of genetic resources is the only way to permanently preserve animals, but there is a lot of difficulty in securing freeze conservation technologies due to different genetic resources freezing methods and survival rate by type of livestock.In the meantime, natural monument livestock has been preserved only as living animals, but if malignant diseases such as foot -and -mouth disease and avian influenza (AI), which are frequently occurring in Korea and abroad, there is a risk of extinction of natural monuments, which requires more essential measures.It was.

In December 2017, the Cultural Heritage Administration signed a business agreement on the management of natural monuments livestock livestock livestock with the National Livestock Livestock Livestock Livestock Electronics Center and Jeju Special Self -Governing Province.Since then, 7 kinds of natural monuments (Jindo dogs of Jindo, Sapsalgae of Gyeongsan, Gyeongju Tokyo, Jeju Horse, Jeju Horse, Jeju Black Cow, Jeju Black Pig, and Hwa -ri -ri, Hwa -ri -ri) of 2,031 genetic resources (2,031?Pavilion) It was distributed to the National Livestock Institute of Livestock Livestock Electronics Center (1,062 points in 6 species) and Jeju Livestock Promotion Agency (969 points of 7 species and 969 points) located in Jeju.It is separated into land (Gyeongnam Hamyang -gun) and island (Jeju Special Self -Governing Province) to establish a strengthened conservation system.

In addition, since the survival rate of frozen genetic resources is finite, it will continue to manage, such as harvesting, inspection, and replacement to maintain the proper amount of genetic resources.

The Cultural Heritage Administration plans to actively discover and introduce various state -of -the -art technologies to establish and operate periodic consultations and cooperation systems for technology transfer with related organizations to prevent the loss of valuable natural monuments and to preserve effective genetic resources..
