Leather crafts start to learn four years ago and sell their products a year ago.The bag is applied to the leather 'carbing' technology, and it is a bag, but it is very lighter than you think.It takes 7 days to ten days to make a bag, and is sold at an affordable price.Leather bags are their own handmade products.

This breeder's workshop has a picture of Chan -oh.The picture below shows the deputies of Chan -oh imported from China and the photographs of the doubt and the lineage under the picture.

I heard the story of how rare dogs, Chan -o, were raised in Korea.

"There was a seven -year -old Kobe in my house. Some people know, Kobe is a dog that drives the first car in Korea."

"One day, Kobe went a walk near the house and crossed the rainbow bridge by being bitten by a neighbor's dog. But the neighbor's house was a" fighting between dogs, "but gave a native dog instead of Kobe."

"I was so angry after that, and I found the most scary dog, and the dog that came home was the lion dog -chan."

Lion dogs, who are looking for a scary dog ​​for revenge of Kobe.It is said that he is getting along with his neighbors.

"Kobe didn't teach me, but I was very good at driving. I always picked it up next to me, but I was driven by one day, and I was driven by myself."This breeder recalls the moment.Kobe's memories are highly executed and shows the driver's license in the wallet.

After hearing the leather bag, cobby, and the story of growing up, they come out and meet the lion.Today, the dog I met at Hyangcheon -chan Owon today is a two -year -old male dog and a one -year -old female.

The lion's dog -chan, who plays 12 wolves alone, and protecting the animals from the beast attack, and the greatness are felt in their appearance.Chan -oh has a strong protection instinct for his owners and his family, so he is alert to strangers.Therefore, if you are not the owner of Chan -oh, you should not reach out to touch.

Unlike other dogs, Chan -oh and Chan -oh, known as the most expensive dog in the world, can only be breeded once a year and at that time, so the population is not much compared to other breeds.Therefore, when the mating period is a place where there is an excellent dog, you will go to a long way.

The people are not accessible to the screens with the crowds.So Ibreader puts it in a picture instead.

'Hyangcheon -chan Owon', which was registered as an international dog federation on March 15, 2018.I was able to meet the excellent lineage.Breeder, who is currently importing four horses from four and four generations imported from China, is breeding a total of eight.In the near future, many domestic and overseas people will visit the excellent lion dog -chan.It is famous for being a Korean specialist.
