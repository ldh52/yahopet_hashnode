Sejong Special Self -Governing City (mayor Lee Chun -hee) will designate one private animal beauty and consignment management business as a “organic public pre -sale implementation office” on the 25th to reduce the proportion of organic animals.

Currently, organic animals in Sejong area are euthanized if they are not adopted or returned after 10 days of announcement, but the number of animals that are euthanized due to the increase of objects are increasing.

Since October, the city has selected the organic animal public sale establishment by reviewing the establishment of organic animal adoption through the contest.

'Fly', located in Jochiwon -eup, designated as an organic animal public pre -sale business, will be in charge of actively promoting adoption to citizens through bathing and beauty while protecting organic animals scheduled for euthanasia for 10 days.

The adoptive individuals are sold to citizens after preparing animal registration and pledge, and if they apply for organic animal adoption expenses within 6 months from the date of adoption, they can receive up to 100,000 won of adoption costs such as neutralization surgery.

The city plans to attach a designated sign to the implementation store, support protection, bath, beauty, and registration expenses for organic animal management, and periodically check the protection status.

In addition, the project will review the additional business in the city area next year based on the results of performance analysis, such as reducing the rate of comfort.

Lee Kwang -tae, the head of the Agricultural Livestock Division, said, “We will actively promote animal protection policies to settle the adoption culture.”
