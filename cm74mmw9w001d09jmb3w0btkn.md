Q: Please introduce the CPF International Carrying Industry Fair.

A: The CPF Pets Industry Fair was first held in 2015 and is one of the few pet -related exhibitions in China, which is held in various regions of China every year.Already successfully held 11 exhibitions, and in 2019, it was held in three places, Guangdong Province, Hubei Province, and Chongqing City, to establish a wider chapter for pet -related companies to pioneer markets in various regions in China.It is also criticized for providing more convenient and efficient purchasing platforms for pet industry operators.

Q: Why did you choose Chongqing as the venue in the CPF International Catlin Industry Fair and West?

A: The western region is one of China's five largest economic regions, and the economy is growing continuously and is rapidly increasing.In particular, Chongqing is the only direct city in western China.It serves as an important engine for the development of the western economic development, and is also the intersection of western economic trade.And most of all, Chongqing is also the largest area with companion goods and industrial size in western China.

Q: What kinds of products are involved in the CPF International Carrying Industry Expo and Western Exhibitions?

A: The main exhibition items of this West Chongqing exhibition can be divided into six categories.Pet food (feed, snack), pets (clothes, toys), pets (cats, lizards), medicines (animal drugs, nutritional supplements), medical devices/facilities (medical devices. Veterinary devices), software/Information (medical care software, medical book).

Q ： Who was the main participating companies of the CPF International Carrying Industry Fair?

A: The companies that participated in this fair include pet sales agency sales agencies, animal hospitals and pet beauty salons, and pet manufacturers.In the same way, major audiences are also visited by people and families with pets, including pet supplies agency officials, pet -related Internet shopping malls, and pets.

Q: What is the most popular product at this fair?

A: The feed and snacks of dogs and cats are the most popular.

Q: What would you give advice on Korean pet products related to entering the western market?

A: In my opinion, the key to Korean companies is to select excellent distributors, and I think it is one of the best ways to participate in related industrial exhibitions such as this fair.

For reference, there are some things to note that Korean companion goods companies enter China.

First, the main customer base in the Chinese pet product market is a young age group born in 90-95.They don't hesitate to choose a smarter product for their pets, so I think they need to be interested in developing IT products related to pet products.

Second, as the Chinese consumption changes, product packaging and designs have a significant impact on purchasing decisions.Creative packaging materials and product designs that can attract consumers are very important.

Finally, in the case of feeds and snacks that pets eat, only products that have been licensed in China can be imported and distributed.Therefore, these products must prepare the required license and related procedures (eg, imported product safety registration, registered export companies, etc.) in advance.

Q. What do you think about the prospects for pet -related markets in western China?

A. I think people in western China have begun to invest more and more expenses for pets, and this field can continue to grow.In China, the perception of pets is gradually changing from the existing 'housekeeping animals' to 'healing animals'.In particular, this year, due to the influence of Corona 19, we know that the cat's breeding boom is on the rise of the chengdu and Chongqing area of ​​the western region.
