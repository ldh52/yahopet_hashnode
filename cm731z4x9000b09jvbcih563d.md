The students may have thought about the problem of organic animals through volunteering today.Pet Care and Professor Dong -Hyun Lee said, “No matter how much the pet industry grows and the pet culture develops, the foundation should have love for pets.Pets are not used to use them, but they planned to volunteer for organic animal shelter, in order to feel that they are our family and good friend. ”
