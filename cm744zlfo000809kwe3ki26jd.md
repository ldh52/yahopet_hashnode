Life pattern is changing to Corona 19.The streets of people were crowded, and refraining from outside activities became a social atmosphere.On the fourth Sunday of March, the wind was blew but the sun was warm, and on the spring day, I visited Pocheon Greenville Dog Cafe, located outside Seoul.

It is a dog statue that welcomes you at the entrance, and you can see that this is a place related to pets.Green Bill, which is about 1,000 pyeong, opened the door and the open front yard is noticed.

There is a dog cafe on the left side of the yard, with three dog pensions on the center and right.

I go to the cafe and drink tea, but my beagle friend knows and speaks next to me.

I met my companions who visited with Beagle in Greenville, and the companions who met Beagles on a common topic were preparing a birthday party for the summer dog.I prepared a cake and prepared a candle for the six -year -old summer.Beagle friends and companions celebrating summer's birthday are full of excitement.

In summer, the guardian has been giving a two -month beagle 'AD', a five -year -old organic dog.Ady, who is also receiving the treatment of heartworms, has become healthy with the caregiver's sincerity, and the heartworm will soon be cured.The caregiver who carefully cares for the heart and nutritious snacks is hoping that he will quickly meet with a new family and adopt it as a good family.

I came to Green Bill as a guest, and I see the wonderful beagle friends.The birthday cake is shared, and the companions talk with the Oson Doson Beagle and talk with each other.

There is also a cute accessory on the wall.

Take a picture of a nice birthday party in a picture and look out for a while.Puppy Picure is also placed on the wall.What are the dogs sitting in the spring sunshine and what are you talking about?

There is also a spacious space outside the cafe.The dogs and dogs sitting side by side with their dogs in the spring sunshine look peaceful.

Greenville has a large yard, so the dog can run around.Many dogs are full of energy.

Valley under Greenville

There is a valley under the cafe.It seems to be a good place to spend time with snacks in a family unit.When the buds sprout and become a green world, it will give you a better view.

Greenville was taken as he went down to the valley.The vintage -style caf√© was in harmony with the blue sky and the green nature, showing off its appearance.

Greenville is a place where you can arrive in one hour by car in Seoul.It's about a month long with Corona 19 ... I've been able to see the scheduled schedule, and in fact, I visited because I wanted to see nature, but I met a wonderful birthday party in summer, and wonderful beagle friends and companionsI also met.

As the life pattern changes, I think everyone will be stressed out without knowing.Therefore, if there is a place where you can go out with your dog while avoiding a lot of people gather, the frustration will disappear.

Freshness and freedom that can be felt in nature from the city center!

If Corona 19 is prolonged, maybe this trend will become one of the new pet culture.

Refreshing air, beagle friends, and pretty Greenville back home.It feels like a drive drive on an outskirts that are not pushed by cars, and it seems to be an element that gives a frustrating heart and gives vitality to life.
