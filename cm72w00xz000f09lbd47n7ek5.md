Cheongju -si (mayor Han Beom -deok) has set up a project cost of 2 billion won this year to provide more quality forest recreational services to Cheongju citizens.

Cheongju City announced on the 29th that it has been able to maintain facilities in the Okhwa Natural Recreation Forest and receive various experience programs for women and children as well as family visitors.

In June, Cheongju City remodeled the toilet of the management office through the improvement of the Okhwa Natural Recreation Forest Facility.

Existing toilets were used for men and women, so they were inconvenient to use, but they were able to use the toilet with confidence by distinguishing between male and female toilets.

Emergency bells were installed in the Popler Scholarship Memorial Hall, Camping Site, and Management Office toilet to enable immediate action in the event of an emergency.

Okhwa Natural Recreation Forest operates a forest commentary and forest forest experience program throughout the year, providing various forest stories and insect ecological education for visitors.

In addition, this program allows participants to observe and experience insects and plants directly by listening to the fun forests and insects provided by experts.

In addition, the "Forest Experience Playground" in the Okhwa Natural Recreation Forest is also in full swing.

The "Forest Experience Playground" is a forest net, a net, and a swing in the forest adventure facility and plans to complete the construction by next month.

Okhwa Natural Recreation Forest operates 31 accommodations in 20 buildings, including four buildings in the forest, which completed the construction of new construction in June this year.

In addition to these accommodations, various facilities are waiting for visitors to enjoy the forest phytoncide such as promenade, auto camping ground, and water playground.

In addition, Cheongju City is currently pursuing a feasibility assessment service to create a forest of healing in the Okhwa Natural Recreation Forest.

The Healing Forest is a project to create a place to experience forest healing programs using various forest environmental elements for citizens looking for recreational forests and to lightly heal the body and mind.

It is expected to create synergy effects to enable abundant forest experiences with existing facilities.

An official from Cheongju -si Recreation Forest said, “We will do our best to create a colorful recreational forest with various experiences and relaxed rest.”
