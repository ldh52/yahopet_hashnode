Nami Island is famous for its autumn, especially autumn, which is the most brilliant season of the year.In early October, cassia and maple trees are the first to announce autumn, and ginkgo trees reveal the golden appearance.Cherry trees, birch and metasequoia are also in harmony with their own colors.Although there are deviations depending on the climate, Nami Island usually has a peak of autumn leaves in mid -October to early November.

The 'Hands and Folong Road', which can be found at the beginning of Nami Island, gathers with yellow and red.The Baekpoong Millon (楓 楓 苑), which can be seen by walking along the road, rarely forms autumn forests.There are also many maple trees around the island of Nami Pungwon, and large ginkgo trees are everywhere between Nami Pungwon and Metasequoia Road.
