Smart and even more connected world-class leader Silicon Labs (Silicon Labs Branch Bundal Daldal), a global semiconductor, software, and solution, shares some of the Wi-Fi network bandwidth with neighbors to realize better devices connecting inside and outside the house.It has announced that it will cooperate with Amazon to support the shared network Amazon Sidewalk. Silicon Labs' wireless solution for Amazon Sidewalk is an object that supports encrypted cloud communication regardless of the protocol type.It allows you to develop Internet (IoT) products.The EFR Wireless Gecko Series' EFR Wireless Gecko Series supports the Sub-GHz and the low-power Bluetooth (BLE) protocol of the sidework.Jake Alamat, which oversees the IoT home and consensus products of Silicon Labs) The vice president said, “With this cooperation between Silicon Labs and Amazon, the OEMs do not have to worry about leaking personal information, and we can realize a groundbreaking user experience that can be safe and easy to set up sidework IoT devices.”The free -operated sidewalk simplifies the setting of new devices, expands the operation range of a narrow bandwidth, and even keeps the latest online state even if these devices are out of their Wi -Fi range.The Amazon Sidewalk allows users to experience the extension of the operating range of smart devices, both inside and outside of their homes and neighbors.For example, a limited offline connectivity is possible for the use of the fuselage detection warning captured by the security camera, and even when the Wi -Fi is cut off, it is easy to handle the new device settings through customer support to solve the problem.You can order replacement parts through self -diagnosis of disorders, reduce the energy consumption of smart locks, increase the scope of operation, and check the location of pets or valuables in an extended area including neighbors.It will be made. Amazon sidework, which has several layers of security and personal information protection, will support low -power Bluetooth, FREQUENCY SHIFT KEYING (FSK) modulation, and 900MHz bands will support CSS (Chirp SPREAD Spectrum) modulation.Jamie Siminoff, the founder and chief developer of (Ring), introduced the sidework in a keynote speech at Silicon Labs Work with 2020 Virtual Smart Home Developer Conference.Shimiov's keynote speech is provided at the link (https://workswith.silabs.com/agenda/session/286423), and Works with Conference website (https://workswith.silabs.com/page/1549396/1549396/Register) can be viewed through free registration.

Silicon Labs (Silicon Labs, NASDAQ: SLAB) supplies leading semiconductors, software and solutions for smart and connected worlds.Silicon Labs' technologies, which have a variety of awards, are creating the future of the Internet of Things (IoT), the Internet infrastructure, industrial automation, consensers and automobile markets.The world -class silicon labs engineering team is focusing on developing products that focus on performance, energy saving, connectivity and simplicity.
