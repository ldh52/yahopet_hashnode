Vegan refers to vegetarians.Recently, Viseromics is emerging as a new trend in society, and non -rearomics combined economics in the vegetarians (Vegan), which means 'economy for vegetarians', and vegetarian materials including vegetarians and animal materials.It means the overall industry that makes things without writing.

The news of Samyang will participate in the Vegan Festival, and I am wondering what the Vegan Festival is.

The term 'vegan', which is still unfamiliar to the general public, has not been so familiar so far, so it was sometimes awkward to meet the person who introduced himself as a vegan.Since the Vegan Festival is the 7th this year, I thought it was an old event than I thought.

Looking around the Vegan Festival, we will encounter a new culture of vegan.Viseromics ... Watching the festival site, the vegan was not in our lives far away, but with Sinab, we could feel that we were by our side.

The 7th Vegan Festival!I met so many people at the venue.Before introducing the vegan culture, I would like to introduce a meeting with people in various fields.Starting, I introduce the people I met at the Vegan Festival.
