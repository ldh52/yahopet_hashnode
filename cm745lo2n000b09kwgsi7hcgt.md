In 2019, the literature 'Animal and Happy', which was organized by Konkuk University, was held.It is a series of lectures, which are companions that both people and animals could think of a happy coexistence.-Addivier Note-

From August 27th (Tue) to September 10 (Tue), Kim Jong -un's companion literature and 'Win -Win Story Meet as Animal Sympathy' were held at Konkuk University Life Science Museum.

The lectures were held on topics such as 'Win -Win of Animal Father, Animal Mother and Hero', 'Half -Half Story and Win -Win of Nature', and 'The Story of Heart Meeting Pets'.I had time to think about meaning, and the main contents of each lecture are as follows.

Kim Jong -un's lecturer

Animal father, animal mother and hero's win -win

Heroes who have divinity beyond human boundaries find out why they were born through animal fathers or mothers.

Through the stories of heroes with bear mother, fox mother, earthworm father, and dog father, we think about what kind of life the animals are asking for humans.

Why was it a bear, not a tiger?Why is Kang Gam -chan, who was born from a star, is why his mother is passed down to a fox?What is the story of a son who killed her father and loved her mother?Why was he the son of an earthworm, not the son of a dragon?

Half -man story and win -win of nature

What did animals mean to humans?Animals are an animal that threatens humans and survives humans with terrible power.Find out what kind of transformation and half -person feelings of human beings about these animals.

Through half -man and animal transformation stories, humans think about how they lived with uncertainty, anxiety, and lack of lack, and have time to bring out the memory of the days when humans and animals interact.

[Significant anthropology] The beginning of win -win, the true sympathy for animals is 'consciousness that the person who kills the animal as needed is his brother, relative, and colleague.'

When you meet pets, the story of your heart survives

We look at the territorial sea, the main character of the novel, The Vegetarian, which causes the vertical relationship between animals and humans to cause our hearts.We share our opinions on the positive symbols and negative symbols of old stories, proverbs, and folk songs and familiar dogs and cats.Just as ancient people painted their relationships with animals on the rocks, modern people have time to talk about what kind of image they want to leave with their pets.

Progress of psychological teaching through pictures

In the last lecture, I practiced psychological healing through painting.After the pet's feet and his hand, he painted this painting freely on another margin of paper.Participants shared their paintings and interpreted the meaning in the picture.

In the lecture, Kim Jong -un also told the story of 'twelve bands' in the lecture, and the story of cats and camels that were not included in the twelve bands, and in Vietnam, there is a native to a cow, Yang -yang, and rabbits instead of rabbits.There was.Mongolia, who was a horse, lived in a close relationship with horses, and the origin of Mongolian instrument 'Madugeum' was also interesting.

Lighting on the wall of Lotteria

On my way home after listening to the lecture, I stopped by Lotteria near Konkuk University Station.As you sit down, you can see animal -shaped lights on the wall.It is the shape of a dragon, cow, and chicken.I learned about twelve bands today, and I saw the animals.It's a really amazing coincidence.

The bear in Dangun mythology was reborn as a human being, but in our story, there are more things about tigers that were not human than bears, and that the ideal appearance that people pursue by era reflects the animal story,To project bars through twelve animals ... As such, we humans are living in a close life with animals.

As we see the relationship between animals and humans vertically, modernity is a time when people think that people are superior, Kim Jong -un says.'What kind of image do modern people want to remain with pets and themselves just as they painted their relationships with animals on the rocks?' What kind of image will you say?

'Exchange with animals is to connect with the newness of my life.'Shouldn't it be a relationship?And shouldn't we draw all that image together?
