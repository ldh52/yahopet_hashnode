Economic magazine Forbes asked the world's top 400 riches.“What is the key to being able to collect such a great property?”People knew how to hear a lot of investment, but the 75% rich answered was completely unexpected."It's to completely eliminate debt and keep in debt without debt."

In our society, “debt” was once indispensable at once, and it was a wealth overtaking lane.If you make good use of the debt, you can jump into the investment without seed money, and if you are lucky, you could quickly be rich.At one time, Gap Investment was popular.It is an investment method that purchases a house with a small difference between the sale price and charter gold for the purpose of the market.If you have a high credit rate, you can borrow a high ratio of money from the bank to invest in malls or officetels to see investment profits.I once received a 90%loan from the bank and bought an officetel, and I moved to KT to pay my mother's care costs with a difference in rent and bank interest.But now the business is over.

We can't get out of the drug called 'interest -free installment' while using a credit card.

We always buy a house and buy a car with debt.I always use my credit card and I can't get out of the drug called <Interest -free Installation>.It is a world where you can't live without a credit card.In Starbucks, you don't get cash except for cards.(In fact, I think this is a big problem.) <Interested Installation> always seduces customers.From one day, cash is not visible well.When you use the card, you may be left before the limit.So I live with persimmons.This remains.However, the money goes out faster than I thought.In the end, our bank account is always empty a few days later.In the credit society, creditors are making their own debts.

Dave Ramsey, the best financial expert, who was a millionaire and went bankrupt due to debt.“Debt is a means of lingering banks.How long will you be deceived by the lies of a financial company? ”The companies and individuals that went bankrupt during the US economic crisis caused by the 2008 Lehman crisis were both people and companies who borrowed excessive debt.Debts always follow risks.No matter how high the return is, the risk will one day eat.No matter how the world changes, my money should never be shaken.

Rather than using the money that will come in, you should plan to use it with money.

Fortunately, I don't have a credit card right now.Sometimes I borrow and use my wife's card.I can only use the check card because I can only use the check card as my credit.Main cash should be used.That was the beginning of my money management.You have to save what is.Rather than using the money to come in, you should plan to spend it with money.I only knew it after this ruined.I wouldn't know too late.I found out that I had a debt of 2.6 billion won.I'm glad now.Because you can start again.It's a situation where you don't have any debt and don't go out.

When I started a bankruptcy trial in April 2018, my total debt was 2.6 billion won.In a total of 4.6 billion debt, the remaining debt was 2.6 billion in debt.However, all the debt of 2.6 billion won were policy financing of banks and governments.In fact, the bank was not a business.When I borrowed money from a bank, I gave more than 80%of the guarantee of the government agency, and the bank had taken over 10 years of interest at 7.8%of the month.When I started a rehabilitation trial in August 2017, it was the first bank called the National Bank that sold apartments with my bonds and collateral as the second financial sector.After all, the remaining debts were all debts to the government.I have been forced 100% through the process of bankruptcy and immunity, but I am trying to recover it again.

As much as possible, we must receive 'investment'

Every year, between February and March, the government solves more than two trillion government budgets, and supports small businesses, ventures, SMEs, and re -entrepreneurs.At this time, many companies chase all business briefing sessions across the country to use this fund, and take a method to pull one more money.However, most of these funds are <low loans> and <low -tone loan>.In the end, it is called debt.When borrowing debt, I lend 2-3%a year, so I think I will pay it back without any difficulty.However, it is money to always run out of the company.Even if the company doesn't work, it is money, and even if it is good, it is money.Eventually it is a slave to debt.So you need to get <vestment> as much as possible.

I have to receive a legitimate evaluation from my company, and I need to start an investment under that evaluation to start and operate the company with an investment, not debt.And if you have some sales and the company has an internal scale, you can get a loan.It should be a loan to handle in the company.That way, it survives.I'm not going to come in my salary, but to make a month in my balance.

Loans are also debt and loans are also debt.You must get investment.So it survives.Never work, don't do business!
