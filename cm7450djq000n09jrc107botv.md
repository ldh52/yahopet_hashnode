Recently, while reducing the psychological and economic burden on guardians on the cost of veterinary hospitals, small animal hospitals operated by one or two veterinarians, reducing the threshold for animal hospitals at reasonable costs, and also make it easy to use veterinary clinics.In addition, it is confirmed through My Pet Plus that the management of veterinary hospitals has also improved.

The water that does not flow is rotten.Pets in pets, now changed to the sense of family…It is time for us to look at the changing perspective, for the 'beings that are coming to our side'.

It should not be pressed to look at the pet that approached the family in the sense of 'pet'.In order to narrow the difference in the view of pets, efforts will be needed for a change of perspective for the next few years, and frequent friction between stakeholders will occur in the process.

Ahead of the holidays of the nation, we welcome the parts of MBC dealing with pet -related issues..Perhaps when the family meets this holiday, I will talk about pets at least once.Our holidays, pets that appeared as the main characters in our conversation…This is the time we need to feel that this is a change that is different from before.
