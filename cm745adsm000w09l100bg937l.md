- Taking a meaningful time to reinterpret and reinterpret the data on animal alternative testing methods

From July 2018 to April 19, 'Seminar for the Welfare of Experimental Animals' was held by 'Action for Animal'.The seminar was conducted to provide external members of the Animal Experiment Ethics Committee to provide animal experiments and theoretical basis for animals.-Addivier Note-

'Seminar for Experimental Animals' of the 5th Animal Seminar

On December 21 (Sat), an action for animals (hereinafter referred to as 'companion') held a seminar for the 5th experimental animal at the Seoul NPO Support Center.Through this seminar, accompanies were introduced to the participants of the introduction of the Animal Alternative Examination and the Guidelines for the Management and Use of Experimental Animals.

In the Animal Alternative Testing Act, Lee Tae -joon, a companion, organized the data, and Lee Tae -joon said, “The content of the Animal Alternative Examination Act is almost unknown.I have prepared this announcement to organize and share with you. ”

As Lee Tae -joon said, there is a lot of attention in the 'Animal Alternative Examination Act' regarding animal testing, but it is still in Korea.In that sense, the lecture prepared by Lee Tae -joon was a meaningful time for future research and knowledge sharing.

The main contents of the lecture (table of contents) are as follows.(The bottom part marked by the dotted line can be a professional content.

△ Purpose of animal testing

△ Animal, Experimental Animal, Animal Experiment

△ Animal replacement test

Experimental methods that do not use animals ... Inevitably, even if they use animals, they can reduce the number of populations or reduce pain.Prohibition of distribution sales of cosmetics, etc.)

Lee Tae -joon is teaching a lecture on the alternative test method.

△ Tacket of Animal Alternative Testing in 3RS

The basic principle of animal testing is called 3R.3R refers to Replacement, Refinement, and Reduction.

Replacement (replacement of animal experiments)

- Preliminary investigation acts to avoid animal experiments in which the design and methods are completely the same (especially when planning animal experiments at the starting stage at a simple level = more useful = preliminary research, preliminary experiments, pilot studs)
- When the research is started, it is not the target of consideration.

Reduction (reduction of use)

- Even if it is not completely the same through the replacement, the research method, necessary equipment and samples, especially animal heads,
- Even if you use all of the two -approved heads based on Refinement,

Refinement

- Each servant performs proper elaborate experimental techniques in a timely manner without repeated repetition, minimizing the pain and pain of experimental animals
- Use of appropriate tools or proven latest tools that allow you to do
- The research atmosphere that can make this possible and the support and support of institutions

△ Overall understanding of animal alternative testing methods

△ Terms: Skin corrosion / cell survival rate in vivo, substance and test substance, administration capacity, accuracy, reliability

This is the main contents of the lecture on the alternative test method.After the announcement, Lee Tae -joon made a quiz, but you can try it.The correct answer is marked with white letters under the view.

Q. Which of the following is not used for animal replacement tests?

① Cow cornea ② Chicken's eyeball ③ Rat ④ (artificial) cells

Answer: All used for animal replacement tests.

(Interpretation) If you quote the distribution sales of cosmetics such as cosmetics (Article 15-2), animal replacement tests ... Experimental methods that do not use animals ...It is said to be an experiment that can reduce the number of people or reduce pain.Therefore, the answer is all used.

The appetizer of accompanying accompanying lectures on the book 'Guidelines for the Management and Use of Experimental Animals'

After the lecture of Lee Tae -joon, the next time he explained the book called 'The Guide on the Management and Use of Experimental Animals'.In the lecture, the representative summarized the contents of the book and explained to the participants.

The main contents of the book include the main concepts, the program on the management and use of experimental animals, and the management supervision of the program.

Since July 2019, a total of 10 times has been held for the welfare of experimental animals.The seminar of companionship prepared for external members of the Animal Experiment Ethics Committee is becoming a seminar in Korea's best experimental animals.The seminar is free of charge, and people interested in the welfare of the experimental animal can be attended after applying.
