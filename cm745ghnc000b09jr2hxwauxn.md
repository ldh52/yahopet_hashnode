There is a dog cafe Dog Bay with a dog playground in Yangju.If you stop by Dog Bay, you can wash your car at a self -car wash that is unusually attached to a cafe.You can see the outdoor playground before entering the cafe.It is a dog playground with blue artificial grass.

As you enter the cafe, you can see the menu table and two big dogs.And there is a cute puppy between the two pictures.This dog's name is 'Tori', and when Tori was about three months, someone said that it was abandoned in a nearby fishing ground.It is not accurate what the breed is, but in appearance, it appears to be the interior species such as Scottish Terrier and Welsh Terrier.

The boss of the cafe gives a delicious snack.He is a boss full of laughter who wants to share anything to the guests who are looking for a cafe.

Drink tea indoors and go to an outdoor playground.When the warm spring comes, you can drink tea outdoors and play with rivers.
