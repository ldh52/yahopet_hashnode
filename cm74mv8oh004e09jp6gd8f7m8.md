One of the Jeonju Pet Theme Travel and Travel Course, we head to Mangone Pet Food & Homemade Snack, a handmade snack shop.I thought it would be a small shop that made a homemade snack for the first time, but this was a big mistake.

In terms of appearance, Mangone Pet Food & Handmade Snack is a small shop that sells homemade snacks in the province.However, there were a lot of experts related to pet nutrition to Mangone Pet Food & Handmade Snacks.

Through Park, I talked about the current address of domestic pet snacks and introduced the Korean Pet Nutrition Association.

The following is a question and answer with Park Eun -jung.

Q: You studied in Japan, can you explain it? A: I tried to study pet nutrition in Korea, but I didn't have much data.So I went to Japan for three years and I got a certificate.

Q: What is the current address of Japanese pet snacks? A: Japanese dogs prefer natural foods over handmade snacks.There are a growing number of people looking for natural foods in Korea.

Q: What is the development of Korean pet handmade snacks in the future? A: It will be enough to make five or six snacks for dogs at home, and the preferred dogs will increase.

Q: The reason why I started the Korean Pet Nutrition Association? A: So far, most dogs have thought that the dogs have been in pain to feed natural foods, but more and more dogs are thinking that they are managed when dogs are not sick.They are thinking about nutrition and specialty even if they do not give natural food every day, and the association began to educate the dogs about the right pet nutrition.

There is no subject for handmade snacks in the curriculum of the Korean Pet Animal Nutrition Association.As for handmade snacks, they only deal with dog cakes and muffins as theme classes.

The association training includes a 10 -month -old pet nutrition lecturer course for the purpose of fostering experts, and a pet natural food manager with three rorses.The professional instructor course is a 100% theory class, and the natural management course is 100% practice.

The association currently has three professional instructors, including Park.Park Eun -jung, the chairman of the association, studied for eight years on pet nutrition, and the other two professionally studied for three years.Currently, the association's education is being conducted in Seoul, Jeonju and Daegu.

It is usually said that Japanese pet culture is 10 years ahead of us.Park, who has been educated by the previous Japanese pet culture and educated by various associations in Japan, hopes that education on pet nutrition will be activated in Korea.
