In conclusion, I am now living a completely different life than before.59 years old this year.Already high school alumni must jump into the business at the age of being prepared to come down or come down from the office.When my age of my age holds my granddaughter, I hold my laptop and documents and enter a new way of life.

PL Co., Ltd.

Looking back, my life was always a life of response to challenges.At the age of 28, he started his work, and he moved to a small and medium -sized company of Guro Industrial Complex, Mando Machinery, and French Thompson Korean affiliates.He has worked in companies in various industries such as electricity, electronics, textiles, and machines, and has been involved in all departments such as purchasing, outsourcing, management, production, planning, and sales.It was a very different life from our generation's friends who worked with a job for a lifetime.

After working hard, I founded a private company in June 2003 after the IMF.After the establishment of the company, he lived for six months in a box of an outsourcing company that had been trading at the previous company.At the same time, he opened a small offer company based on his previous purchase experience.Still, the dream was cursor, staying at home for two weeks before the start of the business, and made the five -year mid- to long -term business plan into <Korean> and <English>.The company's name is Kosoa.It is an abbreviation for [Korea Sourcing Association].In the past 15 years of work, I thought sourcing was the future of Korea, and I started alone without one employee and dreamed of creating a association in the future.

In 2003, I started my business without the money I collected.It was not only 15 years to see how much it was.After the start of the business, there was little sales for two or three years.When I was a direct director, I was completely different when I was running alone with my company.There aren't many places where I could order me who started without anything in my hand.In three years without such a clear sales, the money began to lack.I applied for a loan to the second financial sector, and a financial company had to have guarantors.I uploaded a guarantor as a wife.The financial company informed my wife that the guarantor was obliged to go.It is cold in 2007.He fought with a vending machine coffee at Baekwoon Lake in his wife and Uiwang.When it was difficult, it was a story in the drama that my wife comforted my husband.

My wife was crying and crying and lived in a house wall.The wife hit the company right away and told her to go to a company with her brother -in -law.There was nothing to say.But I didn't want to.I wanted to see the end of the start.It was my first trial that I came to me after starting the business.

If you sit down, it fails, and if you get up again,

Fortunately, there was no law to die.Since the second half of 2007, we have been dealing with domestic companies that make <Dashboards> that will enter Hyundai Motor.When I was managing the manager of Mando Machine, I was a company with me.Suddenly, A and Eul have changed.Our company has been selected as a company that supplies electronic components to the Chinese factory.After signing a purchase agency, he began exporting electronic components directly to factories in Tianjin, China.When we started in 2007, sales of about 20 million won per month have suddenly grew to 500 million won a month since 2012.

Since 2012, Hyundai Motor's hit in China has suddenly increased orders, and sales suddenly increased 10 times in five years.In addition, after the Chinese factory, the electronic components were delivered to the Indian factory of the customer.Since 2012, sales have risen to 500 million a month.The number of employees increased to two.However, the sudden increase in sales made the company gradually difficult to know.As sales grew, funds were needed.The customer asked for two months inventory maintenance.The payment conditions at the end of the next month gradually increased, and at the end, it increased to five months and six months.As sales grew, the management costs from customers decreased from 5%to 3%and 4%.A supplier that supplies important parts has requested a line T/T.Instead of starting with plenty of funds from the beginning, as sales increased, it became more difficult to operate.It was something that should not be done when I think about it now.However, I couldn't stop doing 100%of sales.

Tower of $ 5 million

In 2012, the size was large enough to receive the Tower of $ 5 million, but there was no solid.Each year, the loan received from the bank had to be increased.In terms of customers, the management fee was 3-4%, but bank interest exceeded 5%.It was gradually entering the path of zombie companies.Fortunately, the payment was not a big problem in borrowing bank money because the payment came from China and India every month and cash liquidity was good.However, I had to find a new business since 2013.In addition to the previous business, a new revenue source was needed.That way, I could survive.

Unfortunately, in February 2013, I had a rare cancer surgery called Library.It was a fat mass on the side for a few years, and it was changed to cancer due to continuous stress.In a hospital, a hospital was performed without any cancer and was diagnosed as a cancer after surgery.Eventually, after surgery, he moved to Sinchon Severance Hospital from Pyeongchon Hallym University and received radiation for two months.It was the worst.There was nothing I could do in that situation.Every day, I went back and forth to Shinchon from Anyang.The hospital said that it could be completely judged after five years.5 years of life that must be sent to cancer patients.Can I be alive in five years?

Suddenly, I suddenly came up with the idea of ​​new businesses while round trips to Severance Hospital to get radiation therapy.<Shampoo wrapped without water>.It was an idea from living in a hospital.How good would it be if there was a shampoo that could wash your hair without water for patients who couldn't go?Since then, he has made a power pitch to develop a shampoo that is wrapped without water.It was a new challenge.It was a cosmetics division that was completely different from the existing automotive electronic parts business.The existing customers who purchase auto parts are said to be resting at home after cancer surgery, and they came to the company every day and developed <Shampoo without Water>.Only then could I forget that I was a cancer patient.A new life has begun for me.When I went to Gangwon -do that I had cancer surgery and everyone was healthy, I decided to develop a new product.It was a new challenge to my life.

We were introduced to people who attend cosmetics companies through people around them, and were introduced to design companies and homepages.It began to produce shampoo with the OEM, and it was too much to register as a product name and brand, product and container design, packaging design, homepage, domain, and cosmetics manufacturer.But it was fun.It was proud to make new things, my brand and my products.Cancer could also be forgotten.I quickly made this new product and got a good response from the market, and I wanted to make sales in parallel with existing electronic components.

Fortunately, the response in the market was good.Patents and trademark registration were also conducted, and actively participated in domestic and international exhibitions.<Wearing Head without Water> was amazed at the concept, and everyone encouraged you to be awesome.In the meantime, the number of employees has increased to two in the existing automotive sector, three new businesses, and five.Labor costs have increased.In addition, the costs for product production, marketing, participation in domestic and international exhibitions, and various certifications and standards have increased exponentially, and the company could not operate the company with existing automotive sales and profits from there.He continued to borrow from various institutions.Increasingly, banknotes and government agencies have increased, and the banknote that received a guarantee requested more than 7% of interest instead of unsecured.Through the loans of banks and policy institutions, they have lost their losses in auto parts and have a power pitch for marketing of new businesses.Early time, sales in new businesses were needed, but sales in new businesses were not as easy as I thought.

It was really a star picker in the sky to create a new product of its own brand in SMEs and enter the market.It became daily life to acquire trademarks and patents, advertise online/offline and TV, and go to the exhibition to meet potential buyers to explain the product.For five years before the company was closed, we met 434 potential customers from 32 countries around the world.China has made a strategy as a major export country, and has registered a trademark in China and a trademark in China.I received <Halal Certification> to export the Arab region, and went to Brunei and explained the product.I went to New York, USA, and discussed the procedure to register as a UN procurement product, and went to Washington to meet with US defense equipment companies.We visited many countries such as China, Japan, Southeast Asia, the United States, Europe, Dubai and Iran.Everyone liked it, and everyone was enthusiastic about the new concept.

Since 2016, the product has begun to go out to Vietnam, the United States, and Japan.It seemed to see some hope.But it was there.In 2017, Sadd retaliation began in China.

In 2017, Sadd retaliation began in China.

The most damage from the Sadd retaliation was the Car and Cosmetics, which were all of the company's main business.Hyundai Motor's sales in China were half -side, and cosmetics were banned.The shoots were just blown, but they were cut from the basis.Eventually, at the end of 2016, the worst was suffering.At the end of 2016, it was a huge debt that companies, banks, and policy institutions had to pay about 4.6 billion won, and SMEs could hardly pay off.Only monthly interest is about 15 million won.It was the same amount as the profit of the automotive sector every month.After paying back the bank interest, the money fell.At the end of 2016, he had no choice but to give up the company.After six months from January to June 2017, the company paid one place to the delivery company for the supplier of the automotive sector.

Finally, I found out that there was a system called <Personal Rehabilitation> through the acquaintances around them at that time.There was a belief that I could regenerate again.So in August 2017, I started the Private Rehabilitation Procedure.The court was informed that the remaining value is greater.And about five months of rehabilitation procedure was proceeded.Although the creditors obtained 33%of the agreement, they eventually received the <Rehabilitation> in January 2018 because they did not agree to rehabilitation.

In the end, the company closed in February 2018 and applied for Bankruptcy and Exemption in April.After applying for bankruptcy and waiting for about seven months, I received a bankruptcy decision on November 23, 2018.In the meantime, the apartment was sold as auctions, and I lost everything as a representative of a company and a father of a family.I could no longer do anything I could do.Fortunately, with the help of the law, I finally received the <Implementation Decision> on June 21 this year.As a result, about two and a half years was completed from January 2017 to June 2019.It has been the last two and a half years when strange words have been a daily language for the general public, such as rehabilitation, workouts, bankruptcy, immunity, and auctions.

Still, I was able to live because there was <Interest> and <Love> around.Their presence made me survive.Rather than high school alumni or university alumni, those who met in society helped me more.The person who had previously been the owner of the customer and the high school alumni helped us to use it to save the house.And about 20 acquaintances who always watched and comforted me around.I was not disappointed because they were, and I didn't sit down.

There are 35 Naver bands I am participating.Only 16 dog bands.After becoming an immunity decision, I came out of all that band.For the past two and a half years, I have been in bankruptcy and closing, and I have been immersed.Many people encouraged and comforted.

When I came out, many people began to talk about themselves.In unexpectedly, many people were in bankruptcy and rehabilitation procedures.Through my story, they began to open their mouths.Now, there are some people who come up because they want to see the band and get advice in the province.

I am immunity on June 21 and I live again.In 2019, I applied for the Gyeonggi -do online lecturer project and passed the final acceptance on August 7.I would like to talk about my experience as an online instructor to young people, small businesses, and representatives of SMEs.It's about why it's ruined, how it is not ruined, and how smart it should be destroyed.

On July 28, he was elected chairman by participating in the 21st training of the Korea Angel Investment Association.Everyone was ready to invest in ventures.When I introduced me before them, I wanted to be rich.So he came to the side of the rich man.I want to recover again and invest in young ventures with my money.I want to convey my experience and know -how to them.I am drawing a new future now.

On August 19, he was judged to be able to come to the hospital anymore for the Library, which was surgery in February 2013.And on the way back home, I gave a business registration certificate again.On the day of liberation from cancer, I have a new business registration certificate.The first start -up is 90%ruined, but the second start -up is 90%successful.However, 80%of the employer is said to never re -challenge.I've lost everything in the last two and a half years, but I'm making it again.To enter 90%of successful people.

I started walking again now.However, I know how to stand up, how to walk, and how to fall.I know how to get up again.What I need now is not money, not time.You can stand up again.I am confident that I can admit me now and show my current appearance as it is and get help.

Recently, I've been starting a lot of new things.It is meaningful to recover everything, such as Gyeonggi -do online instructors, Angel investor training, and recovery projects.I support me with my heart.I will start my business again.I have made a decade of work experience and a company based on this, and I have exported more than 8 billion annually.In order to develop new products that are not in the market and to make my brand, I have done everything in the five years of cancer patients.I did a success and failed.And through <bankruptcy> and <immunity>, they are starting a new life again.

I want to talk with startups, youth startups, small business owners, and representatives of SMEs.If you fall down once and you can't get up, I want to tell you that if you wake up again, it's a mistake.When others back back, they want to be a young elder who goes forward again.I think it is a reward for the immunity of me in the country.

On December 11, 2019, I re -establishes with a capital of 10 million won.And now he is developing a pet herbal medicine.

The project received 50 million won from a private investment association at the end of December, and was registered as a venture in January 2020.At the age of 60, I became a venture.And now, the government is in a 100 million won matching fund.Additional investors are also waiting, and the company is supporting the 2020 re -challenge success package project with an innovative failure case last year.The current plan is to raise 3.6 billion won in June.I think I can.

As a pet business, I will recover, and I will make a luxury brand such as Bacchus or Bow Myung -soo with <Herbal Chur>.It will be exported to China, Japan, and the United States to increase the size of the company.The pet business is a second start -up for me and makes me a second life.
