Yoga pose towards the dog at the bottom is one of the relatively easy movements for beginners.

In some ways, it is the opposite of sitting on the desk.

If you take this position, your ankles are flexible, but the hamstrings are tight.But it's enough to do your best and enjoy stretching.

This posture can be moved inside and outside the dog below.Move this or outside as desired, or take a breath in that position several times.

This simple yoga posture will be able to improve your day.
