'Gungdi Pang Fang Cat Festa', the first exhibition for cat deacons in Korea, held the seventh event at the Seoul Trade Exhibition Hall for December 29-30.More than 200 companies participated in the event with more than 350 booths and about 25,000 visitors.This is nearly twice that of last spring's event, and it is a unique exhibition compared to the recent increased cat exhibitions.

The event was presented at a low price of cats, snacks, and supplies enough to entertain the people.Among the products exhibited, even the products that were completed early were coming out, and the exhibitor was a satisfactory exhibition that caught two rabbits, including the promotion effect and the sales effect.

In particular, apart from the food court, the organizers' sense of planning was outstanding.In addition, various seminars and events for the promotion and development of cat culture were also prepared.

On the first day, it was called Cat Mom Academy, such as cats, civil complaints, tNR education, diseases management, and parting.In addition, there were various events such as adoption counseling, photo exhibition, and autograph sessions.This was for TNR (to radiate a cat cat after neutralization), and it was an event that donated some from the audience entrance fee from the organizer and the Dream Pet Food.

Seo Jung -ae, the president of the event, said, "I hope that not only a relatively large company in the cat industry, but also a small company will be an exhibition that contributes to the pioneering and promotion of the market."The first half of this year will be held at the Yangjae -dong AT Center for two days from June 16 to 17.
