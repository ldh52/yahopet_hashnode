The unchanged charm of the tofu completely captivated the hearts of the 'LAN LAN aunt' through SNS.As a result of the genetic test, it is a historic mix dog mixed with more than eight species, and a stubborn outdoor bowl dog that must take a walk four times a day.The chic charm of the puppy, the chic charm of the puppy, the very large hair size and the very big head size and the unique bath.The aunts of the LAN Sun were enthusiastic whenever the feed of the tofu was posted on SNS, and eventually the founder, the founder, was pushed to the position of the "pants."

5. In the book

hello.I am the top management dog tofu of the company called 'Lytheumi'.First of all, I would like to thank you for the book with your willingness to read this book.If you can't read it all, I will not do big resentment.

As you may know, I run the company with the title of “CEO” as a dog's status.That's why many people seem to be misunderstood as a very wealthy dog ​​from the time I was born.

I am a dog that sees the world with one eye.Some people think that my head is just a style because it covers a place where one eye was.The only reason my eyes is one side is to reveal in the text of this book.

It was very hard after I lost one eye.My body hurts, but now I have a lot of worry that my mother is not pretty, but most of all, my mother is not pretty.

In the end, my worries became reality.My first mother left me when I lost my eyes.I had to wait for the day to die in a shelter in the United States._11 〈Introduction to Tofu Representative〉

I never thought about how big it was to be abandoned before I met tofu.Through the tofu, I learned that all life is worth loved and that it is precious in itself.But still many people easily throw away pets, a creature.As you grow up, you don't like the appearance, and you get sick as you get older.Throw away that you can't raise it and throw it away.

Tofu was so.The tofu was also abandoned.But with me, tofu learned how to be loved completely and became emotionally stable.Overcoming the pain of the body and mind, it became a tofu with a bright and healthy appearance.As I saw the tofu changing, I found hope.As I did, someone else could change the perception of organic animals because of small life._9 〈If I didn't have tofu in my life-Mom's side〉

If you have only one eye, you will not feel the distance.The world looks flat and has no perspective like a picture taken with a camera.For example, I think that snacks are definitely at a point, but I'm actually going in a completely different direction.This is because one eye does not know the exact location of things.Snacks were always farther or closer than the streets I thought, and sometimes in a completely different direction.Obviously I saw a bowl of rice on one eye, but my legs kept going to another place.I have become a useless dog that I can't find one rice properly.Useless dogs are abandoned like me.The first mother so abandoned me.The second mother will soon abandon me.I wanted to express my anxiety and anxiety somehow._27 〈perspective "

Korea was not a great place for a mother who returned after studying abroad.Mom was prepared to get a job while working as an English instructor as a part -time job.As my mom was busy, I had to be a snack on the market again, and eventually allergies and skin diseases recurred.

Mom missed the $ 50 dryer that he had left in the United States and wandered around at night, and eventually bought a home shopping dryer.I prepared for the media exams and sliced ​​Yuyamuya chicken.I did not do my writing homework and dried up duck meat.

By the time my mother thought it might have mistaken himself as a Baekjeong in the Joseon Dynasty, my mom came to introduce his snacks on the market.It was packed with dried beef jerky with a small household dryer and participated in the flea market every weekend.'mom.Where are you doing your arms? '_87 〈I can't give a snack to make a snack〉

In fact, my twistingness is a kind of stomach.It is also known as a mop camouflage or slummager camouflage.Do you not say that the Joseon Dynasty was deliberately wearing shabby clothes so as not to be caught?Even so, I am a former location that has risen from organic dogs to the company's representative, and my life is luxurious._161 〈My strength is my strength〉
