In the end of July, Seonyuya Ong Market was held at Seonyudo.In the midsummer night, I met with the artist Jung Il -ho, a picture of the Grim Toglapper of the Ally Cat Friends.

Listen to the introduction of the Alliket Friends and put the introduction video on the screen.

The long cats in the picture, and the works on display in the booth.At first, I thought it was an ordinary booth.But the phrase written on the business card stopped walking…'I am a picture of the painting pet tabletgrapper Jung Il -ho'.'Painting?Pet Toglapper? ”The reporter is curious about what stories are in the phrase.

Seonyuya Ong is the market

The market was held from 5 pm to 10 pm.Alleket Friends booth arrived again after 9 o'clock at night.I sat on a roadside bench and listened to the story of Jung.

Chung said, “I loved them while adopting a sick cat,” he said, “I have a loved one, and I have a new thing on the screen.

Chung, who has been an expert in animation and 3D for 17 years, cares for and cares for the cats, captures them, and draws them in pictures.

“At 7 o'clock in the evening, I went to the park to give rice to the cats, and there were other people like me.I met twice and then I made a meeting naturally. ”He smiled,“ And I made the name of the meeting as Godori. ”

Often, people who take care of long cats have more cat moms than Cat Daddy.However, there are more Catdadi in the “Godori” meeting of Hwagok Bon -dong, Gangseo -gu, where Chung is active.Catdadi is five, including himself, and Catmom is said to be his wife alone.

Jung's work, Moonlight Arong,

Catdadi of a strong body set up a lunch place in the park and feeds them, so the villagers are rarely called.Through the media, I listen to stories about long cat abuse and gaze of cat moms.

Godori meetings are currently coexisting with nine long cats through the operation of the food service center and the long cat neutralization.Long cats live in the park and have a good relationship with local residents.And now these appearances are becoming a specialty of Hwagok Bon -dong, Jung says.

Jung's work, “I am a squirming”

Jung, who has loved drawing and photography since his school days, says he takes pictures to draw the object.So his business card has the phrase “Pet Toglapper”.

Pet photographer, Pet Toglapper!Nowadays, most of the writers who are photographing commercial photos, the reporter learned about the work that the artist thinks that is different from the artists who are open through the conversation.

Chung said, “I think many people will usually think of dark side if they are long cats.I take care of the cats and cats to take care of the cats and take care of the cats in the works. ”

Chung observes the coexistence with the long cat in a bright way.

Like the story of the artist, the news of the long cat and organic animal that we encounter through media or SNS is darker than bright.Wouldn't it be better to look at the same object for the same target?

There is a word 'direction rather than speed'.If you run hard for your goal and go to the wrong place, that's not the case.When we move towards the bright side rather than the dark side, the goal we want to achieve is also positive.

Healthy coexistence with animals drawn by the artist…This is also in line with the goal of Yajoppet.How often do we shout “ya!” In everyday life?This is a word that comes from the mouth 'when what I want is doing well or accomplished.'Therefore, listening to these words means that everyone's desire has been achieved.

The healthy coexistence of people and road cats is contained in the work of the artist.

Catdady runs a meal in the park and cares for the cats!The people in the neighborhood observed this, and now they are living together with everyday life.

The long cats in the works and stories of Chung seem to be telling us to say, 'How should we coexist with long cats?'Jung writer who contains healthy coexistence of humans and animals!His work can be found through goods and exhibitions.

Jung is thinking about the exhibition at the end of the year.The long cats coexist in harmony with the locals…It is hoped that the appearance of the cat cats in the work will be a “candle of hope” that shines around.
