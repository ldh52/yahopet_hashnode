If you go to Seonyudo, something good will happen.In April last year, I visited Seonyudo, which was visited when the Seonyu Village Cat Festival was held.

The news of “Dreaming Genie” writer is on the news and heads to Seonyudo on the last day of the market on the last day of the market.With the influence of Corona 19, the market was held outdoors for a long time.

After arriving in Seonyudo by exit 2 of Seonyudo Station on Subway Station Line 9, and using public transportation, you can leave the subway station.

The market was a cat's cultural festival held in midsummer nights because it was a market.Arrive at the market and head to the booth of Genie's dream.

I heard only the news online under the influence of Corona 19, but after a long time, I meet the artists in the field.Genie writer changed his long hair shortly.Genie writer says that his son Hanul -gun is sixth grade and he spends a lot of time at home because of Corona 19.Genie will hold an exhibition in Seonyudo from August 5th.

There was a writer of 'Hug Pottery' in the booth next to the dreamy Genie writer.I was a writer who met in the fall of last year, and I am very glad to see it.Geni, who dreams of Genie and Nayoung writer, and look around other booths that participated in the market.

In fact, today I came to see Seonyudo Market, but I'm not a reporter, but I don't know.

It was the place where I was taking pictures of the market.It was 'Poming Sugar Suho Pet Workshop' and 'Alleket Friends'.

Interviews are conducted on the spot and also included in the video.It is always fun to meet new writers and meet works.

Ya visits the market, eats at a nearby restaurant, and drinks a tea.I looked at the business card handed over while drinking tea and searched on the Internet.I searched for the “Forming Sugar Suho Pet Workshop”, which makes pet dolls with wool.And I look back at the business cards I received from Jung Il -ho.'Picture Pet Toglers?'

After a late time and questions, Ong, Ong, heads back to the market to enjoy the beauty of the market.

The light of the market that reveals the night of Seonyudo!'Yeah this is the ya in market' is really cool and taste! '

I walked again and met with the artists of "Foming Sugar Suho Pet Workshop" and "Allicat Friends".The interviews and interviews of these “Poming Sugar Suho Pet Workshop” and “Alleket Friends” are introduced in the next article.

Among the many places in Seoul, I think that the name “Seonyudo” is so beautiful.It feels like we are meeting our wonderful old things in the concrete -filled city center.Following last year, the festival was held and the market was held in Seonyudo.Seonyuya Ong Market, which I met at the subway station, is like a thankful friend who always makes me happy and art.
