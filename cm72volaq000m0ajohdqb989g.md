Water', the core word of the business name, contains the meaning of 'creatures that you want to see' in the future.Seven Saturday activities were conducted from July to October.Saturday activities are composed of 'Uri Village Bo, Water Observator', which directly investigates the green spaces of Daehakro and records species of biological species, and 'Uri Village Bo, Water Observee', which observes and draws the creatures of Daehakro.At the end of October, we will run the 'Woori Village Bo, Water Map' program, which is a preparation process for producing biodiversity maps of Maronier Park and Naksan Park.The materials prepared through the 'Woori Village Bo, Water Map' program will be produced as a biodiversity guidance through the 'Woori Village Bo. Water Map' program.The map produced on the theme of creatures that can be found in Daehak -ro is distributed to the bookstore and the village community to promote citizens' biodiversity awareness.The Green Education Center has been a new monitoring program in Daehakro and Seoul Castle Story.Throughout the university -roe breeds, they have continued to pay attention to the spread of biological species protection and biological diversity awareness programs.It is expected to have a positive impact on the development of biodiversity and ecological conservation through the project to create a biodiversity map of the university.The Green Education Center is designated as the Environmental Education Center in Seoul in June 2020, and is trying to continue to carry out regional environmental education.
