On July 4th (Sat), a seminar was held at the bookstore grass mujil.The presentation of the day was 'how dignity is composed: the possibility and implication of the animal dignity.'

The presentation was made by lawyer Kim Do -hee, followed by Kim's presentation.

Attorney Kim explained the prepared materials and presented the topic presented, and he explained the topic of “dignity” that could be somewhat heavy.

The order of the presentation is as follows.

Let's look at the main contents of the presentation.

Entering ⅰ - When changing the question

- In front of the death of a guards that had to eat and sleep in the bathroom where the smell of sewers and the smell of the lax
- Looking at the above, humans ask questions.What is human?What is human condition?What do humans live?What makes humans human?
- That's why I don't hesitate to express this.In the 15th -century Italian philosopher Mirandola, in a speech about human dignity, he said, "Humans have the right to choose whether to lower their status to the level of the beast or to raise them to the level of God."
- But we live in the desperate times of the dignity of animals.
- So let's take a short time in narcissism asking about humans.

Ⅱ The first composition of dignity

What is dignity

- But what is dignity?
- According to various literature, dignity is different from laws, politics, and institutions that have been with the history of humanity for a long time, and are different from the concepts such as honor, respect, dignity, and sublime.
- Article 1 of the World Human Rights Declaration begins in 1948 after World War II.“All human beings are free from birth, and they are equal to their dignity and rights.Humans have been given reason and conscience in natural and must act in the spirit of brotherhood. ”
- Article 1 of the German Constitution is in 1949.“Human dignity is not infringed.All state power is obliged to respect and protect this dignity. ”In today's legal sense, the dignity is a kind of natural human rights.
- Afterwards, many countries will define human dignity as constitution.Article 10 of the Constitution of the Republic of Korea also defines human dignity in the so -called happiness pursuit.
- Up to this point, the dignity of human beings is defined as the basic premise and key principle of the rights that all humans have, regardless of status, role, or status.But it is still difficult to say what human dignity is.

Dignity

- It's hard to find out the dictionary meaning, so let's look at the historical context.
- The era of the 17th and 18th centuries, when the ideas of human dignity began to be formed and spread, are the era of bourgeois classes that wanted to escape from the rule of merchants and landlords and aristocrats (and reading dictatorship).
- Citizens who had some freedom compared to the past needed something to be the standard of thought and action.

The second composition of the dignity

Uncoverty dignity

- There are many arguments that support the dignity of the dignity.
- Nevertheless, to this day, democracy, the constitutions of each country, and various declarations have all been enacted by the idea of ​​human dignity and faith in it.

Dignity

- In fact, human dignity is accepted as the gold and jade of universal human rights, but is limited to the history of the winners.
- The cucumbers have slowed very slowly.Rousseau first mentioned human rights in Social Contract theory.It is ironic that Switzerland was only able to vote equally with men in 1971.This dignity slowly expanded.

IV third composition of dignity

Is dignity valid

- Nevertheless, the dignity is still a valid concern.
- In fact, this reason also contributes to the background of the dignity of creatures in the Swiss Federal Constitution.

Dignity

- Whether all human beings are dignified, it can now be based on international human rights norms, constitutions, and laws, but it is always controversial where the norms and laws are leaning.
- The non -right -renown projects with small stephen wise, Peter Singer, and Jeangual, argue that the characteristics and basic rights of large apes with high intelligence, complex emotions, self -consciousness, and communication with humans should be recognized.
- Masanusbaum directly mentions the dignity of the animal.
- If you are a virtue scholar, Cora Diamond, etc., if you do something based on an attitude that is not merciful, not kind, or not virtue, then the actor at that time is not merciful or kind.
- Ralph Akapora, who attempts a phenomenological approach based on continental philosophy, rejects human -centeredism in the confrontation between human and animals, and proposes a relationship that does not based on animal power or intelligence.
- "We are not choosing innocence and violence," said Merloti, a French phenomenon scholar, who would have been influenced by Arkampora.It is to choose the type of violence.
- Kim Hyun -jung said, “Even if an individual is a person (through socialization), he cannot live as a person without others' help.At every moment of social life, he is treated by others every time by being treated by others.
- If you push it further, in addition to the idea that dignity is essentially accompanied by intrinsic values, some objects only have intrinsic value only if they depend only on their intrinsic or intrinsic characteristics, while the value depends on the relationship with other individuals.It may be able to expand the concept of dignity because it has external value.

Ⅴ In the current law,

Do we have the dignity of animals?

- In Switzerland, whether it was conscious of animal dignity in the Act on Inhuman Genetic Technology (GTG) and the Animal Welfare Act (TSCHG).It is the only defined.
- It is worth thinking about why it was the dignity of animal life, not the dignity of the animal, but it was burdensome to give dignity without passing through something common to human beings.

Ideas that can be obtained from the Swiss law

- Goal Description: Accurately explain the goal to be achieved by intervention
- Presentation
- Suitability: Considering whether the intervention of the problem is appropriate, the weight of rights interests
- Inevitability: If the intended goal cannot be achieved without burdening the animal, it is possible
- Identification and evaluation of deformation
- Identification and evaluation of legitimate rights interests
- Comparison: burden vs legitimate rights profit

In fact, when I attended the seminar and listened to the dignity, I didn't think deeply about it, so the topic came to me somewhat burdensome.However, Kim Do -hee's preparation led to the theme of 'dignity' as if he was climbing the stairs.

In the discussion after the announcement, I could hear various opinions of the participants, and the explanation of the animal category, the difference between life and life was impressive.

The seminar of the Animal Law Comparative Research Council is held once a month, and in August, the seminar is planned for factory livestock, Kim Young -hwan said.
