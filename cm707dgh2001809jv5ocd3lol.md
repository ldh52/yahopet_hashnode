초록

Mushroom-based vegan meat has thus far been used as a food for humans instead of pets. However, based on its texture and nutritional content, it is considered suitable for processing into pet treats.

In the present study, we developed a prototype dog chew with a sweetening coating added to a fungal mycelium mat obtained by culturing the Basidiomycetous fungus Trametes orientalis.

The palatable coating applied to the mycelium mat by plasticizing the mat with glycerol improved the taste and aroma of the existing mat, and the dog consumed it without difficulty.

Future improvements may include a softening process to reduce the chewiness level and a procedure to reduce the crude fiber content. Mycelium-mat-based dog chews, manufactured using eco-friendly materials and processes that are not harmful to the environment are expected to enter the market as eco-friendly alternatives to conventional pet treats.

Controlling their physical properties require further study.
