Hyundai Rental Care, a subsidiary of Hyundai Department Store Group, announced on the 5th that it will launch a rental product of 'Ravibot 2' as a rental product with a startup 'goal song composer' that produces cat IoT devices..

Ravibot 2 is a product that automatically handles feces when a cat enters the square box type and sees a bowel movement.The body contains excretion beds, excretion separators, feces storage pain, and sand storage pain.

When a cat sees the toilet on the excretion bed inside the body, the excretion is operated 10 minutes after the motion sensor recognizes it.The rake on the excretion separator filters out the excretion from the excretion bed and pushes it into the excretion storage pain.

In particular, Ravibot 2 has a 'smart monitoring' function.Customers can use this feature to check health information such as cats and excretion with a dedicated mobile app.Hyundai Rental Care provides a free A/S to Ravibot 2 rental customers for a mandatory use period (36 months) and delivers 'Ravicand', a sandy sand only for one or two months.

Chung Yoon -jong, managing director of Hyundai Rental Care Sales Planning, said, "Most of the pet -related products are expensive and regular management is required, so it is optimized for rental business that can be managed in the long run while lowering the burden of purchasing costs.""We will continue to discover excellent pet related items to expand the pet rental business."
