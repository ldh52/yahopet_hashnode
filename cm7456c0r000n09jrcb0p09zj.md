In February 19, I went to a cat specialty animal hospital operated by Kim Jae -young.I still have a lot of memories of visiting the animal hospital with the oldest cat Minky, the Taigung Cat Animal Hospital.Let's look at the appearance of Taeung Animal Hospital a year ago.-Addivier Note-

- Opened in 1991, where Kim Jae -young's attentive consideration is felt everywhere

There is a Taeung Animal Hospital, a cat specialist in Seoul.Opened in 1991, Taehyung Animal Hospital is the best cat specialty animal hospital recognized by Zata.Kim Jae -young, director of Taeung Animal Hospital, is the chairman of the Korean cat, and among the 19,000 veterinarians nationwide, there are about 1,300 members of the cat.

I arrived a little earlier than my promised time, so I look around the hospital for a while while seeing the treatment.Like a cat specialty animal hospital, you can feel the careful consideration of cats everywhere.Under the guest chair that visits the hospital, there is a separate cat rest space.Unlike other animal hospitals, cats can be free to work while waiting for medical treatment, and they can enter the space alone and stabilize.There is also a hole under the scale, so you can jump in.

Every hospital furniture contains careful consideration for cats.

Looking around, you can see the photos taken with thanksgiving plaques, Kim Won -jang's young and famous entertainers.

Under the hospital counter, there is a message from Mahatma Gandhi.Later, when I met Kim Won -jang, Kim says this article."This phrase is more than I want to achieve."

After a long time, Kim Won -jang, who welcomes the treatment, greeted him, and shows the space where guests and cats wait together, and introduce the 26 -year -old Minky in Korea.Minky, who was taking a nap, also responds with Kim Won's call "Minky, Minky."

The corridor connected to the place where Minky meets is a cat's care space.This space is also considerate of cats freely.The cats in the picture are cats who live together here, and five are living together with the hospital.

Kim Won -jang, who has been volunteering for medical volunteering since 2009, explained the social conference of Jungnang -gu cluster TNR, which was planned on February 24, and international cats planned in March.

The Jungnang -gu Classical TNR and the International Conference are explained:

"I have never implemented a cluster TNR on a local government, but I am going to carry out a cluster TNR for the cat cats in Jungnang -gu on February 24.This is the first time in Jungnang -gu.

The long cat captures will be provided by local cat moms, the venue by the ward office, and the veterinarian medical service team will take the TNR, and then the Catmam will be released again. "

"On March 30 and 31, the international conference will be held at The K Hotel, which will be held at the K -Hotel, which will be gathered by members of Cats in Japan, Taiwan, and China.

It is said that all of Kim Won -jang's cat's love is embodied by the international conference, which is held in conjunction with the local ward office, and four Asian veterinarians.

In the ledger's office, we talk about the international conference with the cluster TNR, and are introduced to the hospital, the operating room, and the hospital room.Which animal hospital or interior tends to be disclosed, but I would like to express my gratitude for this introduction.

While being introduced to the hospital, the guest visited with a sick Nyan.Thank you for your kind introduction and leave the hospital.In January 2017, it moved from the first floor to the third floor.I think it will remain.On the way back to the hospital, take a picture of the hospital below.
