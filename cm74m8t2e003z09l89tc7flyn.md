Exhibition explanation

Space is the dictionary of the noun, 'there is nothing.'Also, one day, according to the book read, 'space is not a real being, but it is a reality.'

In the disorder of the actual space created by humans, invading, absorption, and form (regulation) have realized that they occupy reality (space).

Above all, it is the relationship of power to occupy space (reality).It is an environment (invasion, absorption, format) that is suitable for the convenience of the best predator group.The space created by the best predators is transformed into space invasion, consumable, and transformed into a framework of regulation.And the relationship between predators and the patriarch was shaken with disorders that had nothing to do with the food chain.

It's time to think about the space as a reality.
