The event is introduced at the first floor of the horizontal alley and the 3rd floor store, but the entire street alley was the event.Walk along Garosu -gil and enter the alley.It seems to have entered the building as usual ... It was a very different alley, and there were various attractions from the first floor to the 6th floor rooftop.

You can go upstairs along the stairs, or you can go up the road as if you were rounded around the building.As you go up the road upward, you can see the shops everywhere, and you can also meet the exhibitions of a little artist from Spain.

'The moment you see a picture of everyday life, the young Leonardo's excellent color sensation and sensitivity, admiration comes out.The artist in the child's heart popped out of everyday life and surprised us.He has never been educated in art, and in his ordinary life, he is colored with things.Should I say that it is an anti -peculiar child of an innocent child?Or should it be called a genius?There is no limit to imagination, and that's the fact that art is the biggest message of art ...

On the way up the road, you can meet the goods of the artists at the 3rd floor minifair store.

On a rainy Saturday afternoon, there was a busking performance on the 6th floor rooftop, but the busking was held on the first floor of the snow.If you go up the path of 'alley', there is an open space where you can see the outside.Take a picture of the afternoon scenery of the rainy Garosu -gil from the Garogol.

The horizontal alley visited because I thought I could meet the goods of animal artists.

'Alley' walked along Sinsa -dong Garosu -gil ... In the alley, he has a great culture, appreciated the work, and feels new.

The horizontal alley mini fair is said to be held tomorrow from 12:00 to 10 pm.If it is time, why don't you finish the Chuseok holiday and stop by the artists' works and goods by stopping by the street alley in Sinsa -dong Garosu -gil?
