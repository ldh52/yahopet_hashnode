Looking down from the Mt. Mt.Call.

The crocodile rod in Wolaksan National Park is a healing space where you can observe and view Chungju Lake's unexplored, vegetation, and ecology in close proximity, but many people are looking for a wildlife protection area, so there is no trail.It is a ban.

As the number of tourists looking for crocodiles has increased, Chungju has been filing an application for changing the Wolaksan National Park Plan since 2013, but has been rejected as a reason such as a measure of plant protection and environmental pollution prevention measures and natural environmental damage.

However, as a result of the recent survey by the Ministry of Environment, the non -legal trails visited by the hikers were found to have no group habitats of wildlife, and some of the protection zones were released and new areas suitable for wildlife habitats were replaced by protection zones.

Therefore, using the existing mountain trails, the Chungju Lakeside landscape trail for pedestrians will be legally opened.
