On April 11, 19 (Wed), the National Assembly Library's small meeting room was held in a consumer perspective.The policy debate held on the day was discussed with the opinions of various organizations such as consumers, veterinarians, insurance industries, social commerce, and government agencies.

The policy debate was organized by the Democratic Party's Jeon Jae -soo office and presented at the Korea Consumer Federation.The event was held in the order of discussions by the debaters following the presentation of the national rituals, followed by the introduction of VIPs and the announcement of the presentation by the Secretary -General of the Korean Consumer Federation.The discussion was conducted by the director of the Korea Institute of Livestock and Economics.

In the debate, the co -representative of the Consumer Rights Forum, Secretary -General Park Ae -kyung, CEO of Animal Free Solidarity Cho Hee -kyungChairman Heo -hyung Heo and CEO Lee Chan -bum of the Korea Animal Hospital Association participated.

The main contents of the Korea Consumer Federation and each discovery are as follows.

▲ Secretary -General of the Korea Consumer Federation

The company announced a plan to improve the medical service service, focusing on analyzing consumer damages and use surveys.First of all, as an analysis of the results of the consumer damage survey, the standardization of medical expenses and strengthening information provision were proposed.

In addition, the results of the survey of consumer use of veterinary hospitals were analyzed as follows.

- Most consumers are provided after medical treatment for veterinary medical expenses, and consumers' satisfaction with the medical expenses information is low.
- 92% consumer of veterinary hospitals
- 78.9%of consumers before choosing a veterinary clinic compare medical expenses
- Consumers change the veterinary hospital that was attended by price and over -care experience.

▲ Park Ae -kyung, Secretary General of the Korean Dog Association

There are about 400,000 members of the association, and most of them are raising two or three dogs, most of which are burdened with medical expenses.One of the members said that hospital expenses are burdened and said, "I will only raise this child and I will not raise it anymore."

In general, companions lack animal hospital information.In case of developing advanced countries, we must ensure that the animal hospital information can be delivered, and this information disclosure should be able to select animal hospitals.To this end, it is necessary to form a council that many participate.

▲ CEO of Animal Free Solidarity Cho Hee -kyung

There may be differences in hospitals that treat the same disease, while some hospitals are put in cages, while others are taking care of animals with conditions.As such, there are hospitals that take care of animals in welfare, as well as simple medical services.In this way, there should be a standard for understanding the quality of medical services.

▲ Kim Dae -gyun, the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs,

In a sense, it may be expressed as a situation where consumers and animal hospitals are in conflict.There is a big variation in each hospital that suddenly charges the medical expenses after the pre -information and medical treatment.The solution to this should be solved through 'voluntary judicial'.

The Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs is trying to build a standard medical system.In the meantime, many discussions and information exchange will be solved in the future.

▲ Lee Jae -gu, Managing Director of Non -life Insurance Association

Compared to 10 years ago, the animal culture has changed a lot.Currently, he lives in a pet age.When the times have changed, what is the change in the platform?Now is the time to reach the critical point of change.At this point, consumers will no longer be left.

Don't just look at what you see in front of your eyes, look at it.Consumer -pet markets -insurance industry -veterinarians must work together and grow together.If you look at your position, it is not growth.At least 550 veterinarians will be produced in a year and 5,500 veterinarians in 10 years. To grow together, a systematic and fundamental foundation must be laid, and veterinarians are needed.

▲ Executive director of the Korean Society of Society

How do you set the 'non -paid care standard'?Compared to the general hospital, the company's sales are 1/10.If you want to do notice, you need to give a chance to create a standard.Last year, he requested a 400 million budget from the ministry to make a standard, but did not pass.

The government adds obligations to veterinarians.In foreign countries, we are trying to form a higher level of consensus on each other's responsibilities and relationships by defining VCPR (Veterinarian-Client-Patient Relationship (Veterinarian-Animal-Animal Relationships and Goryeo).Since animals can't speak, they can't explain their painful symptoms, so more care is needed.

Society must determine the standard for VCPR.The veterinarian should focus on the life of the animal, but also consider the guardian's position.

Animal care is not an object of testing, but in the case of startups, animal care is sometimes considered as a money -making level, and is blamed as a veterinarian.

▲ Chairman of the Korea Animal Hospital Association

Animal hospital expenses in Korea are cheaper than other countries, and tuition fees to become a veterinarian are not cheap, and the price of equipped for blood tests is also expensive at 4 ~ 50 million won.In addition, Buga has risen by 10%.In this environment, it is not right to demand a veterinarian's concession.

It was a fine of 30 million won to investigate the veterinary hospital expenses.60%of the companions do not come to the veterinary clinic, but buy and use drugs.As a result, even though the 28 -year -old veterinarian career is less than 1 billion, and 80%of the veterinarians of the same peers are the same as me.

There is no country in which the state discloses medical expenses.In the case of poison, the EU ordered the termination of the water.

Animal medical care is not public health.So there is little national support.I hope the state will be public medical care.It is legally reviewing the MyPet Plus, which is a medical act.

My Pet Plus provides a standard regulation to provide services.Many of the veterinary veterinary clerks in My Pet Plus have more than 20 years of experience and age.

Veterinarians are reluctant to join, and information disclosure and price comparison services will help guardians.I think it might be an alternative and standard for some consumer thirst.

As a result of watching the policy debate today, Lee Jae -gu, managing director of the Non -life Insurance Association, comes to mind."Now is the time to reach the critical point of change. At this point, consumers will no longer be left."Cats who demand information disclosure from the veterinary hospital are demanding improvement and development of veterinary medical services.

In the past high school, there are many memorized sentences as a result of repeating home laws."If I had been a bird, I would have flown to you

Today's policy debate will be the past over time, and many people will think of today."If I leaked then, I would have flew to you."

Today's policy debate is a place that shows that the voices of their companions were ready for the government and industry officials.As a poem of the poem 'This is a noise', it is expected that the flutter of the flag will be an opportunity and opportunity to create a developmental plan for the future.
