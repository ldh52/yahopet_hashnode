Thousands of tails are wagging this National Foster a Pet Month, thanks to Skechers. The Comfort Technology Company® has surpassed $11 million in donations from sales of its BOBS® from Skechers® collection - funds that have helped save and support over 2 million animals in need since its start in 2015.

To commemorate the milestone, the Company has launched a month-long celebration that includes pet adoptions nationwide; grant checks to shelters across the country through its partnership with national non-profit animal-lifesaving organization Petco Love; and the culmination of its Paws for a Cause Design Scholarship, debuting limited-edition styles that were designed by its winning college students.

Printed on one of Skechers' most popular BOBS sneaker silhouettes, the new Paws for a Cause mosaics will debut in mid-June. The designs were created by Cal State Fullerton student Teeny Nadeau in honor of her rescue cat Firefly who recently passed away from cancer, and USC student Maki Shigetani in tribute to her family's dogs, whose unconditional love has helped support her mental health and brought her joy during the pandemic.

The Company's events, in conjunction with partner Petco Love, will include mega-adoptions in Delaware, Florida and Texas; its annual Petco Love register round-up campaign at Skechers stores; a block party and adoption event with Petco Love in New York's Union Square; and regional pet adoption events and grant presentations in North Carolina, California, and Tennessee, as well as in Canada.

BOBS from Skechers will also enter the world of professional sports at the premiere Stanley Pup, featuring NHL hockey teams, athletes and celebrities to generate attention for adoptable pups nationwide, as well as distribute Paws for a Cause scholarships to Nadeau and Shigetani and provide checks to Southern California shelters spcaLA and MeoowzResQ.

Through Skechers' partnerships with Petco Love and its 4,000+ animal welfare organization network in the United States and Canada, Woodgreen Pets Charity in the UK and ALMA in Japan, BOBS has grown into a cross-continental lifesaving movement  - donating funds through purchases of specially marked BOBS from Skechers product, and producing adoption, vaccination and check presentation events for animal welfare organizations.

The BOBS from Skechers philanthropic collection is available online, at Skechers stores, and at department and specialty locations.
