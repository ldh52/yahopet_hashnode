About Wisesky

#### Pre-Filters: Capture Every Strand of Cat Hair

Cat air purifiers are primarily used to filter out larger particles like cat hair. Standard pre-filters can capture some hair, but they might not be effective when the machine stops running, or the filter becomes saturated.

The Wisesky W-Cat Air Purifier features a unique vertical grille design that allows long cat hair to enter the grille and be captured effectively. This prevents secondary pollution and ensures a cleaner environment.

The purifier also efficiently captures dust and dander. It uses multi-gradient electrostatic material, and its disposable primary filter is easy to use, making it a convenient option specially designed for cats. It also features a 360-degree visible design, allowing you to monitor cat hair accumulation and know when to change the pre-filter, enhancing user-friendliness.

#### Powerful Purification: Efficient Air Cleaning

The purification capability of an air purifier is primarily indicated by its Clean Air Delivery Rate (CADR) and Cumulative Clean Mass (CCM) values.

The Wisesky W-Cat Air Purifier uses the WiseHEPA™ filtration system, combining an H13 HEPA filter and an activated carbon filter to remove 99.97% of airborne particles as small as 0.1 microns, effectively decomposing various air pollutants and absorbing smoke, odors, and cat smells.

#### High-Efficiency Sterilization: Protecting Cats and Family Health

To safeguard the health of cats and family members, it is crucial to select an air purifier with a 254nm wavelength UVC ultraviolet sterilization function.

The Wisesky W-Cat Air Purifier is equipped with a 254nm deep UVC sterilization feature that kills 99.9% of germs, ensuring the healthy growth of cats.

#### Quiet Design: Reducing Cat Stress

Cats are extremely sensitive to noise, and the sound of regular air purifiers can damage their hearing or even cause stress reactions. Therefore, when choosing an air purifier, the lower the noise level, the better. It is recommended to select products with noise levels not exceeding 65dB.

The Wisesky W-Cat Air Purifier features a quiet mode and stress-proof fixed speed mode, ensuring cats can sleep peacefully at night and reducing stress reactions.

#### Safety Design: Preventing Electric Shocks and Stress

Ensure that the air purifier has a bite-resistant cord design to prevent cats from getting electric shocks.

The Wisesky W-Cat Air Purifier features a 24V low-voltage design, making it safe even if bitten.
