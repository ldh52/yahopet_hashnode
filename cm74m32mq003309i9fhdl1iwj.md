Our pets have a wider range of behavior than they think.In the case of dogs, the survey shows that the 2-3 square kilometer radius is active.

For these pets, a house where a person lives is not much different, whether it is a studio or a three -room room.For pets, the house is considered to be a home rather than the entire area.

​

Most of them are a big stress if they can't go freely in their own space for pets living indoors.Therefore, our children need a pet door that can be freely carried in the house.

And petdoor is needed not only for pets, but also for guardians.If a pet sees the toilet in a particular place or has a separate pet room, it is a good idea to have a dedicated door for the smell and indoor insulation of the feces.

​

There are two types of pet doors.

From the beginning of the building, or by remodeling, there are cases where a dedicated entrance is designed in addition to the door where the person attends.If you are installed in the existing door, there is a difference in durability and safety rather than a dedicated door.

​

Many kinds of pet doors are also available in Korea.You can choose to fit the size of the pet and the structure of the house.

The form of Korean pet doors is different from other countries such as the United States and Europe.Foreign residential forms are often used in single -family homes, so most of the pet doors that go out of the room are installed, while there are many apartments in Korea.

​

In the case of cats, pet doors can be designed even at high places considering the characteristics of the nyan, not the pet doors that can be traveled to the floor.

​

Both our children and guardians will lead a happy residential culture.
