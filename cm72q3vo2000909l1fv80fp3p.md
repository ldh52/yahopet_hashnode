Two experts in the animal experiment ethics gathered their meanings and published a book in the form of public culture.Let's take a look at the planning intentions, book introductions, author, table of contents, and publishers published by Toyet Press.

Planning intention

In March 2019, the death of the Seoul National University Veterinary Experimental Dog “May” was reported.The people were shocked by May, who was struggling with a skinny body.There was a question of the researchers, and a question was also poured out to the Animal Ethics Committee, which is in charge of the approval of animal experiments.As a professional secretary, he was in charge of the final approval and preliminary review of all animal experiments conducted in four campuses (Gwanak, Yeon -gun, Pyeongchang, and Hongcheon).About 1,400 animal testing plans are received by the Seoul National University Animal Experiment Ethics Committee, and about 30,000 animals are sacrificed each year.This accounts for 10%of the total annual total experimental animal usage in Korea.In this context, the authors wanted to make it easier to understand as a specialist in animal experimental ethics, not only human and animal, but also ethical animal testing, alternative experiments, and animal -related systems.

Animal

'Animal and Human' begin to look into what the animals that were always next to us were in each culture.This book illuminates how the animals, humans and animals, are different and what can be defined by the difference between the world and the way humans and animals recognize the world and themselves.

Many studies are eager for the sacrifice of experimental animals.Park Jae-hak, a professor of veterinary medicine at Seoul National University, a representative author, has been in the past 40 years of animal experiments and a Pesco-Vegetarian (PESCO-VEGETARIN: Fish and Fish, without eating meat.I live as a vegetarian who eats eggs and milk.

In the meantime, people who have the same meaning with Professor Park Jae -hak have been busy with the academic, industry, and government departments, and as a result of informing them of the need for animal testing and animal welfare, there is a little more specific length in which animals and humans can coexist and live legally and institutionally.there is.I think there is hope for coexistence with animals when there is a growing consideration of animals in various fields as much as various perspectives in animals in our society.

'Animals and humans' are beneficial resources that provide insights to animals that want to live as humans, how the scope of animals classified as experimental animals, pets, wild animals, and industrial animals can give to human life.Will be.'Animals and humans' were made in balance so that they were boringly trapped in the strictness of the logic or overheating more than necessary.The way the animal lives in nature has affected humans and focuses on capturing as it is.Through this, we want to keep our eyes on the surrounding animals so that we are not light or heavy.

Toilet Press wrote the original Chinese characters in the classics contained in the text for the convenience of the “animal and human” readers, and inserted 16 reference site QR codes into the footnotes.In addition, the author has placed a total of 15 animal illustrations by the author to edit soft reading.

April 24 was a world test animal day.It is a day that researchers once more to honor the souls of experiments victims for scientific development and to conduct more ethical and systematic animal experiments.

I hope it is a time to think about the sacrifices of animals that have contributed to the improvement of human health.I think that the publication of “Animal and Human” was made at this time.

Introduction to Toyet Press

We leave a short trip every day, where the return road is comfortable.'Toylet' symbolizes the independent space of the busy modern man.

We have a lot of discovery in this only allowed space to spend time alone.

You can think about something without being disturbed, or sometimes you can stop something.

The story of the animals and humans from Park Jae -hak, professor of experimental ethics and Anna representative of Toyet Press.As the author says, I think this book will play the role of public liberal arts.

In addition, the reader will be able to gain an in -depth understanding of animals and animal welfare through this book.

It is no exaggeration to say that there have been no animal experiments and experimental animal culture in Korea.The reporter also participated in a seminar hosted by “Action for Animal,” and most of the data were made when studying at the seminar.In that sense, it can be said that this book has more than a public culture book that provides information on domestic animal experiments and experimental animals.

An animal and human beings published by the chairman of the IACUC and one professional secretary.The publication of this book has left a big footsteps in the field of animal experiments and experimental animals, and I think it is a current ongoing project that will be talked for a long time.
