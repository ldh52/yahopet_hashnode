The National Research Institute of Cultural Heritage (CEO Yoo Jae -eun), along with the US Wafer Masters (CEO Yu -sik Yu), an image analysis software developer, presented a study that estimated the original position of the Gwanghwamun Hatch Award.As a result of restoring the original location of the hatch, the hatch in the west side was about 1.5 meters away from the hatch display in Gwanghwamun Square, and the east side hatch was likely to have been about 1 meter towards the northwest of the hatch.

The place where the hatch was originally located is now used as a road and a square, so only the display is built where it is presumed to be a original location.* Hatch: A imaginary animal that covers the right and wrong, and was considered to be a god of fire or disaster, and was built in important facilities such as palaces and temples.It was demolished with Gwanghwamun during the construction of the Chosun Governor -General in Japan in the 1920s.Later, Gwanghwamun was moved to the entrance of the National Folk Museum, and Hatch Award was moved to the Governor -General's Government Building.Then, in 1995, the Governor -General's Government Complex was demolished, and Gwanghwamun was restored to its current position.* Woldae (月 臺): A wide podium -forms that are installed in front of important buildings such as the Palace of Palace () so far, many studies have been conducted to find the distal location of the hatch..Only the photographs of the glasses taken in the early 1900s were a clue to the rough position.I did it.In the same composition of the past, the current Gwanghwamun area was taken, and the coordinates of the subject in the photographs such as Bukak Mountain and Gwanghwamun were measured by the satellite navigation system (GPS).I analyzed and used a method of estimating the original location in the hatch.

In order to measure the error rate, the actual Gwanghwamun, which was restored based on the relatively accurate basis of excavation, and the coordinates of Gwanghwamun surveyed through the image analysis, showed a slight difference of about 2.5%.

If supplementary in the future programs and surveying parts, it is expected to achieve more improved analysis results.* Analytical Photo Survey: Photo measurement method to measure the actual coordinate values ​​of each point located in the photo and seek the location of the object and shiitake expressed in the photo through geometric analysis.It is meaningful that it was possible to estimate the Hatch Award's original position that was difficult to reveal in the research of cultural property.Although there is an error rate of about 2.5%, if the technology develops, it will be more accurate than it is now.

Furthermore, it is also meaningful to present a wide range of usability in that it is possible to estimate the original position of cultural assets through scientific analysis of records before the excavation.The results of the study will be used for the rehabilitation of Gwanghwamun Woldae and Hatch Awards.

Meanwhile, this study will be presented at the “Cultural Heritage Preservation and Science Conference” held online at Daejeon Yuseong Inter City Hotel until the 16th and 17th.For more information, you can also check out the Non-face-to-face online academic conference (www.conservation-live.co.kr).
