On the 17th of the weekend ecological experience program, “Toptuck Forest Expedition,” on Nami Island, the island of Life, a significant firefly event was held.

The children who attended the expedition made an unforgettable memory by attending the storytelling that 'the Top Grandpa's called the Top Forest Exploration returns the fireflies, the light of the spirit.'

Nami Island is a natural ecological tourist destination where various animals such as blue snow, squirrels, rabbits, and peacocks are played and hundreds of different species of trees.

In December 2017, Nami Island began to restore fireflies that would protect the dreams and hopes of children and to be the spirit of the island.Since January 2018, Oh Heung -sik fireflies, who succeeded in restoring the Jeonbuk Muju -gun fireflies, collected the advice of the chairman of the Korean Association.I started to grow.

Of course, I also faced various difficulties.Nami Island designer Park Eun -jung took care of the first day and night as if the fireflies were treated as a young child to grow the larvae, and in October last year, they attempted their first room.Then, in July of this year, the fireflies that were completely adapted to the natural environment of Nami Island were sparkling with the stars of the dark night sky, and even though they were small, they confirmed the possibility that they could grow in the natural environment of Nami Island.

Park Eun -jung, a garden designer who succeeded in restoring fireflies on Nami Island, said, “Fireflies are not living in imagination, but always with us.””

Nami Island is particularly concerned about the water quality in the island so that fireflies, which are the food of the larvae, can live.In addition to this, fireflies are continuously trying to restore the habitat environment, such as Dasulgi and Aaldit's larvae.

Meanwhile, Nami Island plans to expand fireflies for family customers and forest commentary.The events of fireflies with fireflies with the Toptuck Forest Expedition will continue at 4 pm on the 18th, 24th, 25th, 31st, and next month.
