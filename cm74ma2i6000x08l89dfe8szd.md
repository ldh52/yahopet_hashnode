Yoon Kyung Co., Ltd., a company that studies pet residential culture, introduces the 'elements that the pet house should have' on the website.In the Yajoppet, we look at what these elements are.-Addivier Note-

A house with a pet requires a lot of attention to the electrical device.Especially for children who have long and curious in the house, they should always be careful about electric accidents.

The damage caused by electric shock is divided into two categories: heat and electrical shock.

Oral damage caused by heat generated during electric shock and electrical physiological activity caused by electrical shocks may be disturbed, resulting in wastewater species, waste blood pressure, arrhythmia, and muscular streams, and shocking cataracts in the physically weak eyes.

Electric shock causes damage caused by heat and electrical shock.

Due to the nature of pets, if you are in contact with your mouth, you should observe the gums, tongue, and palate if you are suspicious.

Symptoms that occur during electric shock include anorexia, spilling, lethargy, and shortness of breath.

If you have an electric shock, you should immediately visit the hospital emergency room.And as a first aid, it is necessary to check the children after checking the surroundings of whether the pet is suspicious when the electric shock is suspicious.If you have continued to energize, your guardian may have a secondary accident.

To prevent such an electric shock, KEPCO talks about three ways of life.

1. Wrap protective cables on the front line

2. Put on outlet safety cover

3. Picking an electric stove plug before going out

However, pets can be structurally prevented in pet work.

First, adjust the outlet height.

Normally, the outlet in the house is the height of 30-40 centimeters from the floor.This height is a very suitable height for pets to approach by mouth.In particular, it is very dangerous to contact the outlet with the tongue.Therefore, the outlet should be installed at a height of 90-100 centimeters that pets cannot easily access, and the outlet should be finished so that it is not exposed even if it is easily contacted with a foot.

Second, the low -height outlets required to prevent electric shock by installing an outlet with cover.

The electric outlet, which is difficult to control the height of the toilet in the toilet, installs a cover to prevent contact.

Third, it is a separate switch installation on the contact type heating product.

Nowadays, sometimes the induction is raised, and it may be a problem because it is heated by contacting with a foot.

KEPCO says that it is to be driven out of the outlet to prevent such an accident.

In this case, a separate power switch can be attached to prevent malfunctions by pets.

Petheim leads a healthy pet residential culture.

Electricity is convenient, but it can be dangerous if you use it wrong.

It must be considered so that we can live safely with our children.
