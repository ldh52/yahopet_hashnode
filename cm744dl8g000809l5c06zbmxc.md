Lee Tae -joon of 'Action for Animal', which conducted the seminar, presented the presentation in the order of animal testing, animal experiments, other problems, and scope of animal experiments. The main contents of the presentation are as follows.

Animal test

- Regarding animal experiments, it is defined in Article 2 (1) of the Act on Experimental Animals.
- IACUC (Institutional Care and Use Committe) is called Animal Experiment Ethics Committee, Experimental Animal Steering Committee, Integrated Animal Experimental Ethics Committee, etc.It is only involved until the end.IACUC's qualifications are four hours of education and have no additional education since.
- The terms that need to be understood with animal testing include animal, experimental animals, experimental animal production facilities, animal experiments, and animal experimental facilities.
- The animal testing facility is divided into 4th grade of BL (BIOSAFTY LEVEL).The higher the rating, the more safety devices are needed.

Problems at each stage of animal testing

A (Plan, approval, deliberation)

- Lack of regulations on the scope of research (except for public health related research)
- Loss
- IACUC's lack of decision -making standards

B (Purchase, Sunchi)

- Purchase before approval
- Ugly time period
- During the pure teeth, abnormalities (Jeon Young -sung disease, death) and liability for damage

C (experiment, sacrifice, carcass processing)

- Those who are legitimate, but are not skilled enough to participate in research
- Select an inaccurate method that is not appropriate for reasons that are not inevitably
- The problem that must be reached by reaching its own schedule (moving without a black plastic bag, the act of not being stored in a medical waste bucket, the atmosphere of the early victim))

Other problems

1. 'Experiment' by enlightenment, pharmacist

- The only area that IACUC cannot function properly during animal experiments
- Be sure to conduct regularly
- Reopening is very difficult, and it proceeds with almost most complaints

2. CRO (Contrast Research Organization)

- In fact, regardless of the results of the IACUC deliberation,
- Half of the client's substance

Scope

Experiments for experimental animals, wildlife, and animal vira are also included in the range of animal experiments.(Lee Tae -joon introduced two domestic papers on wildlife and zoo botanical experiments.)

"There are no standards for wildlife and zoo animal experiments in domestic papers. On the other hand, overseas papers have a approval number that have been approved by the deliberation committee before doing these experiments.""I think we need a standard for experiments targeting these wild animals and zoos animals like abroad."

"In the case of overseas, the detailed standards for experiments for wild animals are set," Lee says.

Lee Tae -joon, following the presentation, had time to answer questions by listening to various opinions of the participants.

- In the case of the Department of Livestock, various experiments are conducted, which will also require the deliberation of IACUC.
- Later management regulations are required when radiation of experimental animals.
- The general public also needs to develop animal experiments.
- In the university, it is necessary to study and study animal ethics and animal laws such as animal experiments, such as the 'veterinary department'.
- IACUC's 'I' is an instietal meaning, which may be different for each institution, and it can be a poison for animal experiments because of its strong delegation.Therefore, efforts are needed to 'index' the meaning of 'i'.This will not be tested again about the animal experiments in the past.Compared to the law, it will be a case.
- For researchers who conduct animal experiments, their work is related to livelihoods, so it will be limited to look at the public position.It is necessary to establish the 'Public Policy Graduate School' to see the animal testing from the public point of view.

Lee Tae -joon says that animal experiments are the necessary evils of our society.

Animal testing is Lee Tae -joon, who says 'needed evil' of our society, he says that animal testing is a matter of 'unity and conscience'.Loosen the standard for animal testing and not set clearly ... And the researchers who conduct animal experiments 'How do you treat animals?'I learned something and personally thought a lot.

'Action for Animals' has recently published books related to animal experiments so that the general public can understand.If you want to study animal experiments and develop expertise in this field, please contact us through the 'Actions for Animal'.
