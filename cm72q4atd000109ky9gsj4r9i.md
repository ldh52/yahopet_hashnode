I read Pollan Polan Kim Yun -jung's book, 'Are you talking to your dog?'Now that I read the book, it has been six years since I have been with my dog ​​Alpha and Cheng. Why didn't you read this book earlier?I think.

On November 2, 2014, this day was the day I listened to Kim's education at Seoul Grand Park.As a beginner who knows nothing, I accidentally applied for education and attended education.I didn't know what Polan Pollan was, and I didn't know who Kim was.Of course, I heard a lot of good stories during the education, but I didn't know it was.

Over time, I decided to see a book related to pets in the library, and I read this book as the second book.“Are you talking to your dog?”If you ask like this…“Yes,” I drew me without thinking, and I was very embarrassed.'I wasn't talking to a dog…’

The great sympathy as I read the book was the "signal not to come."Not long ago, I and my family talked with a woman in a local beauty salon, and I heard that there was a dog at home.Because the big dog is calmly sitting, I am glad to talk, face and laugh, and hesitate for a while.Isn't this guy suddenly trying to see me?If the dog was really thinking, it was a moment when I almost saw a big frustration.

Thinking of that moment, reading this book, I understand why the dog did that.I lost my space, and my smile would have been aggressive to the dog, and I tried to touch it without consent.When I recalled the moment when the dog was trying to bite, the dog stopped breathing and seemed to be dead and aggressively turned.At that moment, it fits so well with the signal not to come.

After reading this book, if I meet a strange dog, I think I will do something like the last time.This is because they will not take the dog's space and understand the stress signals sent by the dogs and avoid the seat in advance.As such, this book is a book that greatly helps people understand the behavior of dogs and understand the behavior signals that dogs send to us.

The dog language that this book tells me, the language, seems to have to learn the language.It seems to me that I was able to meet Kim Dae -pyo in a book four years ago at Seoul Grand Park.It seems that I got so precious through a book.If you are a companion who wants to understand your dog, it is recommended to read it.
