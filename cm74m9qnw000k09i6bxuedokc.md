After looking around the Insa -dong street and the craft market, which is held every weekend, the road to Craft On the Hill ... It is fun to go out with the theme of pets.You can also find handmade works made by writers.

As I walked along the road, I arrived, Craft On the Hill, and Shim Soo -yeon's 'Barley Knitting Room' was being held.The barley -knitting room is scheduled to be held for three weeks from September 28 (Sat) to October 19 (Sat).

Shim has lived with a dog since childhood, and Shim's mother is still adopting three organic dogs.

Shim had two dogs before barley, crossing the rainbow bridge at the age of 19 and 15 in March last year.The 19 -year -old mixed dog had dementia symptoms and crossed the rainbow bridge due to deterioration of health, and the 15 -year -old Maltese, who had been together, crossed the rainbow bridge three days later.Barley has been with two dogs for nearly three years, Sim says.

Shim, who had two dogs crossing the rainbow bridge and suffering from Petros, was able to comfort the pain and overcome it a bit thanks to barley.

Many people experience the pain of petos, but it is true that the majority of people still have a lack of understanding of Petros.Our society still sees a companion who is struggling with the death of a pet.I am suffering from my heart alone ... The heart of a companion who left the pet ... Our pet culture is more mature enough to understand them, and I think that a more specific healing plan for them should be prepared.

Barley's knitting room ...

This exhibition is the first attempt by Shim Soo -yeon, who combines his own experience in the clothing field into the pet field.The exhibition was held with pets' clothes and props.Barley's knitting rooms exhibit knits, hats, puppy dolls, and bags.

Shim's knit is not a way of combining the front and back, but a work made by knitting the thread from beginning to end without a break.I heard that explanation and I think it's a difficult work process.

Shim Soo -yeon attempted to combine pet fashion and art through Barlee's knitting room.

The dog dolls, the model, are also handmade works.Wearing a pretty knit and a cute dog doll wearing a hair hat ... I'm looking at it.

Pet clothes and pet fashion met with Shim Soo -yeon and were newly expressed as art.In the meantime, Shim Soo -yeon's love of dogs was contained, and the high -quality skills of Shim Soo -yeon, who could not easily imitate anyone, were hiding.

The autumn sky in September ... The blue autumn sky in harmony with the clouds is impressive.After the crowds of Insa -dong and the freshness of Dang -gil, they arrived at Craft On the Hill and met the warmth of Barley.

In the winter of white snow, I drew my house and alpha in a knit and played in the snow.Knit of dogs that feel warmth ... It seems to be a pet fashion that goes well with the white snow.

At the exhibition held at Craft On the Hill Gallery until October 19th (Sat), you can feel the love and warmth of barley.
