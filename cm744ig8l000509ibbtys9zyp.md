'Cross', a reporter who thinks only as a woman.Asks this question like a bad way."Do you have cross men too?"“I thought it was a similar question and asked,“ Yes, ”the European embroidery representative answers.

“Then the older men will be mainly?”, “No, there are a lot of young men these days.A little while ago, a man in his 30s came with his girlfriend and introduced the cross to his girlfriend. ”

The cross, the men who thought they were only women, the men also, that young men…

Thinking of 'Yes,' and looking around the works on the store, you can see unusual works different from the cross.

The reporter who was curious, and now he sits and asks about the number of jewelry.In addition, Sohn Young -mi, CEO of European livelihoods, solves the curiosity with expert advice.

The number of jewelry is not so difficult to work like a cross, but you can attach jewelry materials of various colors on the drawn patterns.

“I also raise cats, and my companions will send me a picture of my pet.Then you can put jewelry materials on the pattern. ”

If you send a picture of a pet, it is said to make a jewelry pattern and send it back home.It takes less time to make a work than the cross, and it does not require technically high skills, so it seems to be suitable for the general public to create as a hobby.

After seeing the pet cross, I entered the store and heard about the “jewelry number”.He also explained from Sohn the cross and the French embroidery.

The work completed for one year to produce the work

Sohn explains that it takes a lot of time to make a work on the cross, and introduces the work that it took a year to complete the work."Is it one year?"It is a word from the mouth of a reporter who is out of the cross.

Sohn is exhibiting in the store rather than selling because of the artist's sincerity and soul.Sohn is conducting cross -trained for students in the Uijeongbu Underground Shopping Center.

It helps people who are crowded, computers and people who are in a cell phone, and that the elderly are said to lower the probability of dementia.The cross is forced to immerse yourself while making a work, and then the thoughts in the head disappear and the concentration is high.

What about?Isn't this a good hobby that companions can do as a hobby?

Regardless of all ages, the number of cross and jewelry to help improve concentration and prevent dementia…Why don't you make a pretty work with our cute pets and walk on the wall of the living room?The stress of social life is blown, reducing the time for children to live in cell phones, and preventing dementia in the elderly.
