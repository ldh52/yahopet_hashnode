Considering the current progress, the pet playground will be completed later this month.The pet playground is 95m2, which costs about 100 million won.

It is divided into small and medium -sized dogs and large dog areas, and play facilities such as climbing, falling, and obstacles are installed.The dog playground will be operated in winter and will be done in April next year.

Prior to this, the municipal government will operate a playground temporarily in March next year.In addition, the company plans to establish a detailed operation plan after completion.
