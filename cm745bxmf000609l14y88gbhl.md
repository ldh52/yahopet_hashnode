In a village in England, there was a theater for Porn.

But this theater was always a deficit.It was not allowed by the British men who had pride as a gentleman to go to the theater to see Porn.

After a few years of deficit, the theater owner had to close the door, and one day I had a drink every evening.

“Yes, I'm putting a short <Cultural Movie> in the middle of <Porn Movie>.”

And the theater was hit.The reason is to save the British gentleman's pride.

A theater in England, which screened cultural films between pornography, was a big hit.

At the end of the one -hour pornography program, the next program showed a 15 -minute short cultural film, and operated a theater by inserting cultural films between pornography.British gentlemen did not go to watch porn movies, but went to see cultural films, but because of time, they watched pornography.He gave him a comfortable view of the porono movie.

Sometimes it's a very well made product, but it's often a struggle because it's ahead of the times or because it's not right in the market.In this case, don't give up, let's change your thoughts.If it is not A, if it is not B, to C.It is time to sell only one well like the old days.Too fast conversion is a problem, but it is also a problem to insist with too much.If you face a problem, you need to change the accident.You need to find a new solution.

The era of selling only one well is over

This transition of thinking is called pivoting.It is an approach to Plan B that the company can take if it is not possible to create a market by completing the current product or to create a market that can be a foothold for growth.

Beginning companies or startups often focus on one and rather do not see anything else.You can focus on one function that developers think are important and kill other important functions needed in the market.You need to abandon your house and create the desired features in the market.

When I went to the exhibition with <Shampoo Wrapped without Water>, there is a story that representatives of SMEs told me.If you keep coming out for three years at the same exhibition, you may not see the representative.At that time, there are two cases.If the product is so great that you don't have to go out anymore, or if you don't already come out.I also went all -in for nearly six years with only one <shampoo wrapped without water> and eventually closed the company's door in February 2018.Don't just develop it, but what would it have been like to sell what others have made together and make some revenue?

We need to abandon the house and create the desired function in the market.

You don't have to be too immersed in one.Free thoughts rather make a jackpot.

One of the hardest things in military life is the passage of barbed wire.Under the barbed wire, there are muddy water and gravel.You have to wear it there, wear a gun on your side, tear your clothes, bleed your arms, and cross.

When I passed the barbed wire so hard, the instructor said:"The best way to pass the barbed wire is <Bypass>, fools!"Yes.The instructor told me to pass the barbed wire, but he did not say that he was below.우회를 했으면, 옷을 찢길 일도, 피가 날 일도 없었다.

Sometimes, I need a detour of thought.
