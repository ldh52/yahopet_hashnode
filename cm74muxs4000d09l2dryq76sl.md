Something of pets sent to us, Kaming Signal!We think of the meaning of pet behavior through the Kaming Signal, but Kim Hye -jung, CEO of Tellington, who completed the Telington teaching training course, should observe more carefully through Telington's teal.He says he focuses on what the small movements mean.Kim Hye -jung, who has completed the training course for Tellington T -Touch Fractioner for the third round, is preparing to publish a book 'Your Dogs and Touch' to inform Korea.In this article, Kim Hye -jung introduces the Telington teaching that he felt through the training process.-Addivier Note-

In October last year, Taiwan has completed the 3rd TTOUCH PRACTITION training course in Taiwan.In 2018 and 2019, the reason why he decided to decide on Taiwan after the second process in Japan was that Japan was on the waiting list because there were many people who wanted to participate in the teal fractilener.With advice from POTTS, he applied for Taiwan and went to Taiwan.As a result, it was very satisfying, with many participants in English and many emotionally similar participants.

Tellington's T -Touch wants to learn many companions and experts from Japan and Taiwan to China, which is becoming a program for pets, horses and emotional stability, health and happiness.

What I felt when I participated in the Telington T -Touch Pract Terminator course in Japan and Taiwan was that it was a good program that Telington teaching was not yet known in Korea.I was attracted to the attraction of diversity.Because of this charm, so many people in Japan and Taiwan may apply and continue to develop.

Since there are no experts in Korea yet, I am trying to learn and learn more as the first teaching fractilener.

Tellington Tach Touch was developed by Dr. Linda Tellington of the United States, initially began with a circle on the shoulder of the horse to relieve the pain of the horse.

The main purpose of the circle teaching, which is the basis of Tellington's turther, which draws a circle with a hand on the skin, is to improve cell communication and help the body's healing.

All cells in our body functioned, worked with other cells, and showed communication, and the cells in the hand conveyed a message that supported health to the other cells, which is a person with a personIt enables animal communication.

The basic premise of Tellington Method is "By changing your posture, you can affect your dog's behavior."

Tellington Ttouch Method for dogs is a way of gently respecting the animals, the body, mind, and spirit of animals and caregivers.Tellington's tier is made up of the following elements as well as bodywork that uses a circle known in Korea.

• Bodywork and Body Wrap, called Tellington Ticket Attack

• Training using tier and lead strings, and ground -advanced education called Playground for High Learning

• Tellington Training Equipment used for training

Tellington tee can use these methods and tools to set a positive image of how dogs behave and how they want to be related to the guardian, to change like that image, and further develop the trust of dogs and people.

Tellington is translating the application for domestic distribution.

As I participate in the Telington T -Touch Fractioner course, I think that the idea of ​​animals deepens, especially in order to live with pets, the mind and view of pets should be changed a lot.

Through the Kaming Signal, you think of the meaning of pet behavior, but through the teaching practitioner process, you have to observe your pets more carefully and focus on what the small movements mean.I am learning.

It should be the ultimate goal to learn whether the small behavior of our pets does not mean stress, fear or anxiety, helping you to solve and endure it, and to be well -being together.

Telington tee will inform more people because it can be based on the respect of a pet that can advancing domestic pet culture, and the teach book that is working on "Introduce your dog and tee".Throughout, we will try to inform the various benefits of tee touching dogs.
