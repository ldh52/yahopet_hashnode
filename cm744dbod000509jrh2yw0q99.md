In December 2018, the 'LOV ERKE CATS' exhibition was held at Yongsan Station I -Park Mall.The exhibition was held until March 2019, and this big exhibition has not been held in the last two years.'The Nyan Love Like Cats', which was able to immerse yourself in the cat's charm, looks back on the scene.-Addivier Note-

I went to an exhibition that could be soaked in cats.The place is the 6th floor of Yongsan Station I -Park Mall, Popcorn D Square Museum, and the period is from December 1 to March 3 next year.

As a rural man, I arrived at Yongsan Station I -Park Mall and suffered a little bit of finding Daewon Museum.When I bite the road, it would be faster to ask where the popcorn D square was rather than the Daewon Museum.If you go straight along the Starbucks on the left, you can arrive at the Daewon Museum.

The place that made me laugh while watching the exhibition was 'cats who went to Joseon'.Our cats, who are active in the Joseon Dynasty, look back on our history as we look at it, and on the other hand, we smiled at the mouth when the cat was anthropomorphic.
