In July, Seonyuya Ong Market was held in Seonyudo.It was scheduled to be held from July 23 (Thu) to 25th (Sat), but it was not held on the first day, the 23rd, due to the rain.

On the last day of the market, I headed to Seonyudo to meet cat writers, and while looking around the booth, I was able to meet the “Poming Sugar Suho Pet Workshop”, which makes pet dolls with wool.

I think I saw the needle felt through a blog a long time ago, but it's the first time to see “Needle Felt” with your own eyes.

Like rolling snow and making a snowman, Poming Sugar is a place where you can make pet dolls using wool!The needle felt I met at the scene was nice to see an interview in the field.

Lee says that he runs a workshop at Seonyudo, where the market is held.When I searched the Internet, the workshop was also introduced on TV.

Lee, who has a certificate of "pet wool map leader", operates the process of certification and hobby classes in the workshop.

When I asked about the certificate and the workshop, "The certificate can be obtained through the Korean Pet Craft Association, and there are about 20 workshops in the country, such as Poming Sugar."The companions being experienced are also participating in the workshop class and participating in making pet wool dolls. ”

A place where you can make your own beloved pets and make it yourself.Not only hobby but also the 19th era startup item.In addition, remembering a pet that crossed the rainbow legs, and always creating a pet doll to be with it seems to be a significant thing to commemorate the pet.
