We met a villa -only villa for pets who visited the venue at the Goyang Flower Exhibition Hall, where the Earth Conquest Supercat Festa is being held.Yeo -jae is said to have moved in 12 out of 14.

Sung Mi -hyung and Kim Sa -ran, the representative of Yeo Yeon -jae, who visited the venue, shows the photos of Yeo -jae and introduces Yeo Yeon -jae.

I returned home and watched the video again and looked at the characteristics of Yeoyeonjae.

'A villa that can be occupied only when there is a pet, removes the stairs, installs it, installs the water of the pet after going out, installs a sealing fan for ventilation, removes the threshold so that the pet does not fall, and the pet does not slipUse, bottom outlet location upgradation, folding door, obtained and drainage facilities, so it is easy to clean, installation of evacuation stairs for pets'

It seems to contain all the elements needed to live with pets.

Some of the tenants have adopted organic animals, and some have moved for a sick dog.There is also a separate household for a deacon family who lives with cats.

'It is a pet -only villa designed by a dog cat and 14 generations of two buildings with dogs and cats.'... Yeo Yeonjae!

A happy house with a dog, Yeo Yeonjae
