The increase in trademark applications related to companion products can be found in the growth of the companion industry due to the rapid increase in the population.

The increase in one or two households, which account for more than half of the total households in Korea due to low birth rates and aging, is interpreted as a major cause of the increase in population, and the PETCOMY market, which means the industry related to pets, is in 2020.It is expected to exceed 3.4 trillion won.

Meanwhile, the product and service business designated when applying for trademarks is also changing from "dogs, dogs, and dog bowls," and "dogs, dogs and hotel operations, dog -related beauty and bath businesses."

In addition, 'pet funeral service business, GPS location tracking device for preventing pets, pet psychological therapy, and pet health care service business is also designated to reflect the recent market conditions.

The reason for the increase in individual and SME applications is that pet -related industries are often suitable for small -scale operations, and individual business owners are easy to enter the market at a relatively low cost.
