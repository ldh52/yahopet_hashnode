The 2019 Songdo K -Pet Fair, which was a pet fair centered on the dog, and Gungdi Pang Pang Cat Festa, a cat fair that I visited on this day ... I visited the two fairs, and I think that students have witnessed and felt the development of the pet industry..Also, the difference between a dog and a cat fair would have been felt.

Earlybird students who understand the characteristics of dogs and cats and witness the development of related industries.I wonder what the fair will look like.

The future pet industry, which will be created by growing youth, will be written in anticipation of going in a creative and developmental direction.
