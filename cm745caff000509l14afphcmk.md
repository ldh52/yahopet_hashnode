In 2020, Parasites wrote a new history in the 101 -year -old film industry in Korea.The parasites have been awarded four crowns in the Academy (Oscar), who received the Award, Director Award, Screenplay Award, and International Film Award.As a result, parasites have become a new legend in the world and domestic film world.In addition, the Korean film industry is newly facing the Renne Xiangs era.In the narrow Korean film industry, which is only 50 million, there are occasional more than 10 million movie audiences.In the meantime, there are already 18 films that have attracted more than 10 million people.

In addition, the international market, veteran, stealing, 7th room gifts, assassination, mine king, taxi driver, Taegeukgi fly, and Busan, lawyers, Haeundae, Silmido, monster, king man, parasite, etc.These are the films.

By the way, I remember the film called Old Boy, which was only 3.3 million people.It was an unusual film and a meaningful film.As far as I know, Choi Min -soo, who is the most troubled by the question, is Choi Min -soo, who plays the film, Old Boy.Based on the setting of the Japanese comic "Old Boy", it is a film by Park Chan -wook in 2003, which depicts a man who was trapped without knowing why he was imprisoned.In the 2004 Cannes Film Festival, he won the grand prize for the first Korean film.

'I keep asking a wrong question, so there's no right answer.'

At the time, it was a film that made various attractions and stories, such as the unusual of the film plot, the gymnastics scene of Yoo Ji -tae, the hammer action of Choi Min -soo, and the scene of eating mountain fishing.Even in the United States, the origin of the film, it was a remake.

By the way, when the film is last hit, do you remember the conversation that Yoo Ji -tae (Lee Woo -jin) to Choi Min -soo?"Your real mistake is not to find an answer. I keep asking a wrong question, so there's no right answer. Why, why did Lee Woo -jin lock?

Incorrect question.Choi Min -soo tried to solve the reason why he was trapped for 15 years.Why am I trapped?But that was not the answer.Why did Yu Ji -tae release me in 15 years?That was the answer.

When I was young, I have a question that I have received once."Dad likes? Mom likes?"This is the simplest ignorant question with dichotomy.A weak child even cries about this question.The opponent asks the question, and the question is not the option.The child must give up one of the mothers and dads.It means to give up 50%of the values ​​that the child has lived.To choose one person for a child is to give up half of your life.But the parties are often smiling and forcing them.It is the act of giving up on itself.

"Dad likes? Mom likes?"We are always used to these questions.“Do you want to do this?Do you want to know? ”There is no middle.You have to make a decision whether it is good or not.Society always forcers such a decision.There is only Plan A, there is no Plan B.So, it is a failure or a failure.Once failed, stand up again in the sky.

"Dad likes? Mom likes?"

Ask the children again."Dad likes? Mom likes?"At that time, crying is the best choice.The child's choice is right.This is not that!You must choose either.So office workers always drink.Always fill the glass to the constant.There is no answer.Still, you have to make a choice.That is the favorite method of Korean adults and a question that a company wants.

Sweet answer to short answer questions.I have learned from school.But I have to learn and grow to choose the answer.Everybody lived in the four -line multi -lived life.I don't use it myself.I always had to choose the right answer.There was always a trap in the problem, and I had to learn how to avoid the traps in the problem.So, the way we have lived has always had to find the right answer in the wrong answer.As a result, how to live is similar to what we have learned.

We did not always ask ourselves, but lived a passive life to answer the given questions.The subject of the problem is not me, but I lived with the question.So, life is hard.It wasn't the way for me to live ...

Inefficient problems create inefficient answers.Again, let's ask a child.

"Dad, who is better among my mom?" Similar questions give their children's choice.There is room for choice.It is a good question.This is a question that allows children to answer comfortably.You don't have to throw away one.Just as much as you like.

"Dad is much better!"You don't have to cry.Rather, sometimes the person who asks a question should be well asked if he wants to score more to his child.The child takes the initiative.The child has a creative thinking.

NEGO, from the opponent's point of view, giving answers, so that you can easily get the answer.

Looking around, see many people living in this way.People who ask questions from my point of view, not their position.Those who are only forced to answer from my standpoint.When you meet such people, your heart becomes stuffy.This is not a matter of flexibility.It makes the opponent uncomfortable.Sometimes there is a story to the staff.Negotiation.Nego we often talk about.We must always negotiate with our opponents in our lives, and we must exchange and receive each other.The process is Nego.I am called NEGO <Nego>.NEGO, from the other person's point of view, you can easily get the answer.It's not the answer I want, but I need to get the answer I want to get the answer I really want.

The same is true for questions.You must do it from the other person's point of view.That way, you can get the right answer.You should ask questions that can come up with creative answers.That way, society is breathing.A good question creates a creative society.Find the right way.

The right questions can be answered correctly.
