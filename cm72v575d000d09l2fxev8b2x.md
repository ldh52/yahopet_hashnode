The Literary Publisher has published the Millennial Journalist Philippe Philippe Filip Filip Filip, who worked in the French media 'Le Nouvel Observateur' and 'Rue89'.Will basic income make people lazy?Is populism a social evil that threatens democracy?Is the sharing economy an alternative to capitalism?The authors say that these questions are no longer local.This is because these questions will draw the future, and since the beginning of the 21st century, capitalism, nationalism, and nationalism have lost their power to lead the world, and the New Nomal era, where anxiety became routine as the future prediction became difficult.The global fan -decristed in 2020 with the New Corona Virus infection (Corona 19) has raised such anxiety on unprecedented scale, but it is not easy for citizens to answer what to pay attention to in order to overcome the anxiety.The authors of the class say that if they clearly understand the 10 concepts that will lead the 21st century change, they will be able to overcome the anxiety of the New Normal era and prepare a new future.It explains the history and major controversies of the concepts and major controversies such as animal rights, transhumanism, alternative currency, populism, feminism, and platform capitalism.The concepts introduced by the authors have been dealt with only in the debate of civil activists, but now.It is no exaggeration to say that most of Sisa News contains more than one of these concepts today.It focuses on basic income agenda, including income and local currency.However, there are not many controversial voices and 'populism' pledges that are concerned about decreasing productivity.However, the relationship between the sharing economy and the existing system has emerged as a new issue since Tada's court workshops. What is 'feminism'?The 21st century democracy was combined with feminism.In November, Democratic Party candidate Joe Biden designated Kamula Harris as a running mate.It is also interpreted that she is not only her practical skills and public awareness but also black and women.There are many controversial controversies such as the protection of labor rights and monopoly, but it is said to be the victory of the platform capitalism, which the fan Demick sang, and the world shares a sense of crisis that it must be disconnected from the world so far.Futurist Jeremy Rifkin insists on the global Green New Deal, saying that he should be alert to the climate crisis.Economist Jang Ha -jun warns that he should abandon his obsession with growth that has been driven by polarization.Known as an excellent analysis of hate, Masanusbaum emphasizes the dangers of politics connected to cultural hate.Choi Jae -cheon, the authority of ecological research in Korea, point out that the perspective should be changed to ecological center, not human -centered.In short, it is 'social transformation' that domestic and foreign scholars talk together. The concepts such as capitalism, which have led the world so far, are losing the power of change by deepening growthism, environmental destruction, hate and discrimination, economic panic and inequality..Now the world is demanding change, and the world is in front of these 10 concepts that the world has said and argued to go to a better tomorrow.Even in the confusion of the future, you will be able to think more reasonably about the direction for the better future.
