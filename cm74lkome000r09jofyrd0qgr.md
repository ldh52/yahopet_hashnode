On September 5, 19, on Thursday, September 19, a lecture was held at the Seongcheon Academy Lecture Chairman in Yeouido.The lectures were held four times on topics such as 'All Life helps each other', 'the eyes of living things are beautiful', 'What is a problem for livestock infectious diseases and livestock killings', and 'energy placement of healing'.In this article, the contents of the lecture are summarized.-Addivier Note-

On September 19 (Thursday), the third time of literature, the companion of Park Jong -mu, was held at the Seongcheon Academy in Yeouido.The lectures are under the topic of 'All Life helps each other', 'the eyes of living things are beautiful', 'What is a problem of livestock epidemic and livestock killing', and 'energy placement of healing'..

The theme of the lecture was 'What is the problem with livestock epidemic and livestock killing?'The lectures of Park Jong -moo's veterinarians have been more realistic because they have recently been killed by pigs.

The story of livestock murder seems to be a heavy and difficult topic.However, Park Jong -moo's lecture was buried with stories and warmth as in the last lecture.Listening to the lecture, I nod my head.

Park Jong -moo, a veterinarian who explains the evolutionary theory

For example, as shown in the picture above, I don't know what's talking about 'Evolution -Gyeongjae's criticism', but it is easy to understand if Park Jong -moo's veterinarian explanation a few words.

The lecture was followed by ▲ the reality of killing due to livestock epidemics ▲ the background of livestock killing ▲ the problem of killing and its founding factory livestock ▲ Alternatives to overcome killing.

The reality of livestock killing

Livestock killing should be 'Article 20 of the Livestock Infectious Disease Prevention Act', 'Livestock Investigation or Cultivation of Livestock Investigation and Precisional Examination, or the owner of livestock with clinical symptoms must order the killing of the livestock.'It is happening.

It is unfortunate to be killed by infectious diseases.

As a result, at the end of 2010, the Andong foot -and -mouth disease was killed 3.5 million for 153 positive reactions, and in 2016, 38 million poultry was killed for 418 positive reactions in the event of avian influenza.

Background

The background of killing was divided into direct backgrounds and advanced backgrounds, and the direct background was divided into 'historical process specified by foot -and -mouth disease' and 'risk of influenza virus variation'.

▶ Historical process ... Foot -and -mouth disease showed less than 5% of the mortality rate for immunity, and in fact, the UK farmers did not think that foot -and -mouth disease was a serious disease.The British government demanded a policy of killing a murder as a prerequisite for protecting the expensive cattle of rich farmers and a prerequisite for joining the European Union.

▶ The risk of influenza virus variation ... It is said that it has been defined as a killing object because there is a risk of spreading to the spread of infectious diseases such as the Spanish flu (estimated 60 million deaths).

It tells the background of livestock killing

The deep background of killing was divided into 'medical background' and 'political and economic background'.

▶ Medical background ... Reductionist disease tube is said to be a medical background of killing.Reducing the disease is to reduce the disease to any factor.'Reducing the disease of the disease is a microorganism that causes infectious diseases or infectious diseases, but since the organism has resonated for many years in an environment with microorganisms, various microorganisms coexist without damage to their lords.'

▶ Political economic background ... Park Jong -moo veterinarian explained this part.

In order to make the world during the World War, Fritz Harbor, a scientist called 'Harbor-Bosch' invention Gathering> War> Military Factory into a fertilizer production plant, operating a chemical fertilizer production> Land is a surplus agricultural product that exceeds its own circulation/ Land devastation ...

The military factory that produced gunpowder was converted to fertilizer production plant.

The production of chemical fertilizers was produced over -produced, and the grains produced were used as an animal feed and were also provided to the third world.However, surplus agricultural products, which were supported by the nature of the third world, resulted in the blockade of 'the foundation that agriculture in the third world could grow'.

Excessive corn and soybeans at low prices had to find a new market, and the market was the feed of livestock.

The cow originally lived with grass from the meadow.

"Traditionally, farmers raised cows, pigs, and chickens that are helpful for agriculture, fed by by -products of crops, and made compost, but they were feeding corn or soybeans for livestock.As a result, the pastures that were grazed for the livestock were not needed, the livestock were trapped in a narrow barn, and in the name of increasing efficiency, they were raised in a narrower space.

These fertilizer production and livestock forms in the United States have had a significant impact on Korea.Due to the imports of cheap overseas agricultural products, domestic farmers could not survive, and this farming phenomenon continued to occur, and in 2013, agricultural workers reached 5.7%.

Economic concepts of scale were also applied to livestock

In the case of the livestock industry, for competition with foreign countries, factory livestock, which raises more populations in a narrow space, has been achieved.This is the result of livestock authorities recognized as the only alternative to securing price competitiveness by only the size of livestock and industrial organization.

"In a poor environment that cannot be properly in the sun, the large -scale dense breeding livestock has reduced the immunity of livestock, making livestock vulnerable to infectious diseases," Park Jong -moo says.

After examining the reality and background of the killing of livestock killings, the veterinarian finished the lecture by explaining the 'killing of killing, the problem of the foundation factory livestock' and 'alternative to overcome the killing'.

"Bacteria and bacteria have always been around us through long history, and are now in my body and in each of you. By the reductionist background of medicine we have made bacteria as pathogens. All life is organically organicallyWe are a mutual relationship and we have the duty and responsibility to respect those beings.It should be done in a way. "

All creatures exist in relationships and must respect each other.

Park Jong -mu, a veterinarian who says that all life exists in a relationship and must respect each other ... Infectious diseases with high mortality rates such as avian influenza and African pig fever require immediate measures such as killing measures, but as in the case of foot -and -mouth disease, the lungs rateFor this low epidemic, he says he needs to avoid killing and seek ways.

Humanities lectures by Park Jong -mu, a veterinarian on the theme of 'Contribution and Mind Healing with Animals', and Humanities School on the way home from Seongcheon Academy.It was a time of 'animal', 'building relationship' and 'heart healing'.On Wednesday, September 26, a lecture will be given to the 'Healing Energy Placement Flower', and the introduction of complementary therapy batch flowers will be introduced.The place is Yeouido Seongcheon Academy Lecture (Life Officetel Building No. 1309).
