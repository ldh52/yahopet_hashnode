On November 14 (Sat), the students of the Early Bird Program Pet Care, Osan City, conducted field trips at Seoul National University and Cat Garden.The Early Bird Program is an early career selection support program for the first and second grade students in Osan.

Pet Care and Professor Lee Dong -hyun began in 2019, and this year, we are studying pet animals with students in Osan Seongho High School.

This year, pet care and classes began in September due to the influence of Corona 19, and Pet Care and Pet Care visited Yeonam University, Animal Companion, Korean Dog Association, and Star Dog Entainment as a field trip.

Last Saturday, on -site experience learning was conducted on the theme of 'animal test' and 'organic animals', and Seoul National University's Graduate School of Dentistry heard an explanation of animal experiments, and the cat gardens were explained about organic animals.

Seoul National University Graduate School of Animal Laboratory

At the Graduate School of Dentistry, Seoul National University, I visited the animal laboratory after being introduced to the animal test by Professor Sang -Ho Roh, chairman of the Seoul National University Animal Ethics Committee.In the fields, Anna Jangan University Bio Animal Protection and Adjunct Professor and Animal Laboratory Geun -hwan Researcher helped with explanations.

Animal experiment ... It may be a difficult topic for students in high school.However, experiencing animal experiments will play a big role in forming the right values ​​for 'animal experiments' in the future.One student who visited the animal laboratory said, "It was good to check the associated parts of the zoo breeding environment."

I am the first to visit the animal laboratory.Things that were abstract and vague about animal experiments were resolved through tours.I think that the field experience through the Early Birds program will have a big impact on this correct values.-Addivier Note-

There are mandatory animal experimental ethics committees, including Seoul National University and other animal experimental facilities.

Cat garden

After completing field trips to Seoul National University, students went to the cat garden after lunch.Cat garden is the first outdoor cat cafe in Korea, and most of the cats live here.

On Saturday afternoon, the cat garden was crowded with guests who came to meet cats.And the cats were walking leisurely as if they had been known for a long time.

"Cats are an area animal. So if you look around the cafe, you can meet cats that are resting here and there. Most of the cats in our café are organic graves.

Pet Care also visited the cat garden last year.One year later, in the memory of last year's seniors, the cat garden was the most distinct.The students chose the cat garden as the 0th place in the field.The explanation of the organic seedlings was good, but the students seemed to be healing just by touching the cat and spending time together.

If the traffic in the city center was smooth, I would have been able to spend a longer time with the cats.It was an hour's visit to the cat garden, but I said that the students felt less than 30 minutes.To make you feel a time of an hour like 30 minutes ... I think this is also a force for us to give us.

While writing

Dreamy students think about their careers and experience the field in person!High school school days are the same time for anyone, but it is not a given environment for anyone to experience this program.

Some students have applied for an early bird program, and some students are interested in this field because they are interested in this field.Whatever the reason for applying for the program, students will be introduced to the new field and visit the field, and think they will draw their future.

Early Birds Program helps not only to choose a career but also to form the right values.

Last Saturday, students had time to think about animal experiments and organic animals.These two themes are the topics that are currently an issue in our society, and will continue to do so.Students will remind them of the animals and people they meet in the field and give their own opinions on two topics.

... this is the idea of ​​the older generation, and maybe students will give an answer to the problem we have not thought of and present a unique business model.

In addition to the purpose of the program of early career search, the early bird program will help to form the right values.
