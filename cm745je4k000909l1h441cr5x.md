In 2019, the literature 'Animal and Happy', which was organized by Konkuk University, was held.It is a series of lectures, which are companions that both people and animals could think of a happy coexistence.-Addivier Note-

On August 6 (Tue), Konkuk University's companion literature 'Animal and Happy' was held at the Konkuk University Industry -Academic Cooperation Group.The second companion, the literary course, gave a lecture on the theme of 'Eating Animals, Animals, and Friends'.

Fifteen years ago, he was a member of the ordinary public, and he was also a deacon who lives with one cat.For 15 years, the representative, who has seen various animal problems and hears the voices of the field, has held the second course of literature, which is a rejection of the subtitle of 'various ways of human beings'.

Why don't you eat dogs?

The objective reasons for dog meat food (lack of legal standards, inhuman treatment, etc.) were presented.

There is no legal standard for dog (meat).Related laws include livestock law, livestock hygiene management law, food hygiene law, and laws on the management and use of livestock manure, but there are no clear standards for dogs (meat) under the current law.Dogs (meat) are managed in accordance with the Food Sanitation Act, but the livestock hygiene management method applied to all livestock products does not contain the contents.After all, there is a contradiction that is sold as food without hygiene management.

- Why is the dog industries inhuman (1) breeding -floating ... It is a poor environment that cannot be in it for a while.
- It cannot fundamentally prevent the inflow of dogs (to the slaughterhouse).
- Slaughter -Can be slaughtered according to the taste of the guest
- Electric slaughter -no standard
- Transport -Density transportation because of the aggression of dogs ... Dogs that are disconnected from the world can show wild aggression.So even if you have a small gap where you meet each other from the outstream, you can fight each other, and if you get hurt by the fight, the commodity will be reduced.To prevent this, you can see the dogs in the vehicle by densitating them.

The appetizer of action for animals is the second course of literature where the representative is a companion.

The characteristics of utilitarianism and the goal of animal rights movement were explained.

The characteristics of utilitarianism include hedonism (happiness: good/pain: evil), universalism (we think equally of the suffering and happiness of all beings), the resultingism (the result of the results and the results), and the largest happiness.

Utilitarianism considers whose suffering is bigger and considered animal pain and human interests.

- For example, let's compare the pain of dolphins and the joy of human beings.Those who capture dolphins on a small island in Japan, after dolphin, leaves only young dolphins and other dolphins kill in the field.The young dolphins who witness this scene may be depressed or suicide in severe cases.It is to take away all their happiness and suffer pains that humans capture dolphins to see the dolphin show.
- The goal of the animal rights movement is to control and manage human violence.

Why do pigs eat?

It explained the damage of factory livestock, and the problems of life -like animals and exhibition animals.

- What is the real reason for killing? ... for economic reasons.
- Two days after the birth of the calf, the reason I broke up with my mother was to produce more milk.
- Do you need fur?
- Why is the whaling unnecessary?
- Hunting allowed, where should I do it? ... Programs such as 'Animal World' aired on TV were taken in artificially created ecological parks, not African nature.It was artificially constructed, resulting in an imbalance between the species, and the park side forcibly adjusted the population.In this process, hunting is allowed, which is inevitably resulting in poaching at the moment of allowing the wild.A few years ago, a doctor who lived in an ecological park was hunting in a restricted area and spreading it to SNS.
- Picture to take pictures and fishing ... If you use a flash at night, you can put wild stones at risk of blindness, and the fishing needle thrown away by the fishermen can take the life of the wildlife.
- Kidnapping ... While there are no parents who have been hunted, they bring the babies left alone and leave them to the shelter are not a structure but a kidnapping.
- Inappropriate breeding
- Problems of Experience Zoo -Feeding ... If only one food is sold at the experience zoo, and if the visitors give it, the animals can get serious nutritional imbalances and malnutrition.
- Algae
- People don't know much about wild animals, so it's not love to take care of them without any information and knowledge.

The appetite of accompanying accompaniment explained about dog meat foods, goals of animal rights movement, ruins of factory livestock, wild animals, and exhibition animals.Following the lecture, during the Q & A session with the participants, I had a time to talk about the questions that the attendees were curious about.

"The reason why a person coexists with animals is not only because of love, but also respecting each other," said the representative.And he ended the lecture with the words, "Wouldn't it be necessary for animals that occupy the same space?"

The second course of literature, which was held under the theme of 'Eat Animal, Animal, Friends -Animal -A Different Human Wose to Animals', the message that the course wanted to convey to us is ...'Let's respect the words and the animals that coexist with us. '
