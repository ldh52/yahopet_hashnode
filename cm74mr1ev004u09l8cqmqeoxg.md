Is it because of the pain of Lee Ae -ri, who said that he crossed the rainbow bridge a year ago at the age of 13 at the age of 13?She says that adoption is not easy.He volunteered at an organic dog cafe near the house, and moved to the Seoul Animal Adoption Center and came to volunteer today.

Lee Ae -ri, who suffered the pain of Petros, says, "It is hard to adopt at this time, but I think it is possible to adopt children's short -term short -term appeals."

The response of the street performances on the streets is good, and it is said to leave overseas performances at the end of July.Overseas performances will be performed in England, Hungary, Denmark, and Italy with the work of 'Material 2 Materials'.
