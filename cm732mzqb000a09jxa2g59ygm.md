The Barun Books publisher has published an essay “Cat Ray's Gift”.

### Book introduction

“All the moments with you were very precious.Your eyes, your warmth, your crying and your playfulness.Ray, I miss you so much.I really want to see you a lot…. ”

I realized the essence of love in the breakup with Ray, who loved.I learned that love is not just time to be together but to convey the love to others.Also, watching the last moment of beloved Ray, I was caught up in the irreversible sorrow and shock, and each of his actions came to surprise and wonder.It was a moment when I recognized that I had to renew my thoughts and perceptions about the animals I knew.

Many people try to interpret animals in line with human needs, but as they live with cats, I look back at the value of the animals through the world they show.They are not living according to human expectations, but creatures that create their own unique and artistic worlds.

This book contains the feelings of love and farewell learned by interacting with beings, not humans.It tells the reason why you accept the difference and even love the pain through a special being called a cat.Cat Ray was the most precious gift for my life, which is a record of enlightenment.

### Recommendation

"Cats came to the world to break the orthodoxy that everything in the world should serve humans."

I like this one of all the quotes of the world of cats, Bassist Paul Gray of Rock Band Slip -Tick.If you have been together with a cat, you will know.The center of the world is not a person.The personality, wise, and beauty of this creature, called cats, causes a huge wavelength to human life.Unfortunately, enlightenment always comes late.

The author of this book faces the death of a beloved cat who was a member of the family and then reflects the cat as a being.Four cats, who have joined the family members in various stories, join the joy of life and penetrate them in their own ways.It is the honesty of the author.

The fear and embarrassment of those who started the life of a companion without human beings and notice, and the raw feelings that are felt in the process of watching the earlier extinction because they have a different life cycle with humans.The book confesses why he has no choice but to love cats as a existence, and why cats are the most valuable gifts for human life.I recommend reading to everyone who wants to know what life is with a cat.
