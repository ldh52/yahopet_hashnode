Chuncheon City said that the organic animal adoption center, which is being built in the old 102 supplementary parking lot, will be completed this month.

The current fair rate is 80%of the organic animal adoption center, which costs 580 million won.

The organic animal adoption center consists of 184.33㎡ of total area, adoption café and kitchen for the first floor, and the second floor.

In the meantime, the city has been promoting the establishment of an organic animal adoption center to establish a systematic organic animal adoption program, improve the adoption of organic animals, improve awareness of organic animals, and spread the culture of life.
