- A book that is the basis for understanding dogs

My house has a poodle and Maltese Alpha, and these two are so different.

Poodles run for a cheerful personality and run somewhere, but Maltese is calm, and when he walks, he always follows me by my side.

The starting point for understanding dogs, & lsquo; all dogs are different & rsquo;

I read Animal columnist Kim So -hee's book, “All Dogs are different.”The first edition was published in 2010, so it was already eight years ago.

When I only heard the title, I thought, 'Yes, all the dogs are right, how did you solve this book?'However, as the book's subtitle “51 Stories hidden in time”, the artist explains the origin and characteristics of the breeds in time, and is writing this book.

### Breeds (varieties)

There are 51 different breeds in the book, and as I read each breed story, I thought that this book would be enough to serve as a textbook for each breed.

In fact, people who haven't seen a lot of breeds may not have a lot of vividness because they don't come to mind, but if you read this book after seeing YouTube or images, you will understand it faster.

The books are commonly known, and most of the dogs may have met online or offline if they are a little interested in dogs.

### Dog Show and Breeding Group

I've been to the dog show for a few times, and I've seen the introduction booklets distributed in the field, but I didn't understand what dogs belong to each group.The dog group group also thought that the classification of AKC and the UAKC classification were different, so it was just a group of similar groups.

But after reading this book, I could easily understand the dog show group.It wasn't hard to memorize it.The seven groups introduced in the book are as follows.

Dog show group is described

- Hound Group: A dog that chases mammals using visuals or smells
- Working Group: A dog with a healthy body and a strong stamina
- Sporting Group: A dog that helps new hunting
- Terrier Group: Awesome dog that catches small animals living in the ground
- Toy Group: A small and cute dog like a toy
- You're a sports group: dogs that are not included in other groups
- Hurding Group: A dog that drives livestock so that it does not scatter

Seven groups are introduced in the book.

After listening to the names and explanations of the group, it will not come to mind what kind of dogs in each group will be, but after reading this book, it is easy to understand the characteristics of each group and the groups belonging to the group and their dogs.

The book makes it easy to understand the characteristics of grouped dogs

### What you need to know as a guardian

If only the origins and characteristics of each breed were explained in this book, it would have been simply a dog encyclopedia, but in addition to the characteristics of each breed that companions need to know, it is very helpful to the reader.

It is also a sad reality to adopt a dog with a dog with a hunting instinct at home and adopted without understanding the characteristics of these dogs in the process of adoption.And this wrong meeting is eventually creating a bitter ending of organic dogs.

This book helps to understand a dog

Before adopting a dog, you need to know whether the dog is an active individual, a calm and quiet thing, how to manage the hair, whether it is a loving person, and the individual to raise in an apartment.There are many things to know in advance.

If you like hunting dogs, you will be suitable for a wide garden or countryside where you can be active.

It is essential to check the origin and characteristics of the dogs and select the right breed to grow.If you adopt a puppy without knowing these features, you will not know yourself, and you will be the cause of your dog's problem.

I wrote a story about meeting the hidden generations of Yangpyeong, and he also said that he also divided the dogs by varieties and observed the dogs and found the solution.He also seems to be looking for the cause of the behavior to be corrected, depending on the dog's breed.

It is necessary to understand the general characteristics of the dog breed

### All dogs are different

Read this book and take a look at the dogs of my dog ​​and Alpha once.

This book explains Poodle and Maltese like this ... 'Poodle: Churchill's love, Maltese: 12 billion won heritage.'

There are also stories of characters who loved dogs in history, and now, time and space are different, but they have a common sense of love for dogs.

The book introduces anecdotes related to the breed.

I remember learning the subject of “interceptive communication” as a department class.

Looking back at the class, it is different from the way of expressing intercourse, and it is the beginning and core of intercourse communication that I understand that one action can be accepted in a different sense for foreigners.It was the content.

In addition, we need efforts to understand different cultures.I want to interpret this book, “All Dogs are Different,” personally, “Basic Books for Understanding Dogs.”

So I would recommend reading the previously read 'Are you talking to your dog?' And this book 'All Dogs'.It doesn't matter which book you read first, but if you are adopted, I want to read this book first.If you first know the characteristics of the dog to be adopted and decide to adopt the right adoption, it is because of the idea that it is the starting point of the most basic animal love.

The dogs living with us have a genetic characteristic that the dog has.Such dogs are living in our environment.As a result, all the dogs are different, just as there is no person in the world.

Books that understand their companion dogs and look at the present are 'All dogs are different'.
