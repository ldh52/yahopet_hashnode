The seminar was conducted by the representative of the representative (hereinafter referred to as 'companion') for animals.It was the last time, so I thought it would be a little easier, but this is always a gap.If you think about it and attend, it's easy to get a big nose.I thought, 'It's the last time, so it will be a little easier.'

Classes were conducted for about an hour and the seminar attendees were given a certificate.It was a somewhat difficult and unfamiliar content for experimental animals.And I took a break and the class went on.

Many people did not attend the Corona 19, but after the process, I received a certificate.If you are not together at the last time, a certificate will be sent by mail.

Looking back, I was out of the test animals, but I learned the concept of the concept, and I found out that there are people who are struggling for experimental animals.

'Seminar for the Welfare of Experimental Animals' ...

When most people were interested in organic animals, there were people who showed interest and love for experimental animals.So I want to applaud people who are walking silently on this road that no one goes.With the idea that these efforts will become a grain of wheat, and they will harvest rich in the harvest season.

During the Ph.D.

Accompanies will continue to conduct seminars on farm animals following the experimental animal seminar.In the following farm animal seminars, many meaningful people will attend and study together.
