Personally, I have been operating a pet -related blog for eight years, and I met a lot of people online and offline, but most of them looked at the pets in a fragmentary view related to their fields.However, Dog Korea, led by Chairman Hong Yu -seung, was a company that has a deep understanding of pets and organic animals, as the four -year preparation period tells us.

I talked to Dog Korea Hong Yu -seung and listened to Dog Korea.

Company promotion

To promote the company, we are publishing the “Dog Dog Special Newsletter Dog Korea”.No. 3 will soon be published and distributed in pet fairs and exhibitions.In addition, we are promoting and promoting Korean, Japanese, and Chinese. Dog Korea plans to enter the global market as well as in Korea.

Convention with related organizations and companies, schools, and media

Dog Korea is Dr. Byung -Joo Park, the Korea Animal Hospital Association, Dr. Joo -Hyung Heo, Director of 'Korea Police Dog Training School' Choi Seung -yeol, 'Wonkwang University' Professor Kim Ok -jin, 'Chung Hyun Animal Hospital' Dr.Through agreements with various organizations and personnel in Korea, we explain the purpose of the company to create a country without dogs.

Dog Korea's motto

It is to create a country without organic dogs.

How to implement the motto

We are trying to implement the DNA Real Name History.DNA test will be conducted at the stage of adopting dogs.If a companion is in an environment where a dog is in an unprecedented environment, such as studying abroad, disease, and military enlistment, he will say, "Do not throw it away."

We will build a pet sale town in Gimpo, and we will issue eight documents together when adopting dogs.Documents issued after the DNA test include △ lineage certificate, guarantee certificate △ veterinary hospital association certificate, △ Lotte non -life insurance, △ GPS necklace △ liability guarantee contract △ health white paper.In addition, the adoption price will be cheaper than anywhere else.

Gunsan Dogland is a place with the best facilities in Korea, and while the dogs live here, the cost is burdened by the owner, and the dogs will be adopted as a new family.

In addition, we will gradually increase protective facilities such as Dog Grand by using closed schools nationwide.

From the stage of adopting a young puppy, a real name system is performed through the DNA test, and when adoption, it provides elements that are necessary to care for dogs such as animal insurance, healthy white paper, and GPS necklaces.By achieving a real name system, the dog's lineage is proved.You can check your deputy and your mother.This can be easily checked online.

When adopted, I often do not think about the coming future, and I often think about it and adopt it.The children who were young when they adopted a puppy…Grow up, go to college, study abroad, go to the army, get married, and give birth.When you adopt your dog, you didn't think about it in 10 years.Among the reasons for abandoning pets, organicism due to this inevitable environment is also a high proportion.Inevitably, when you are in a situation where you need to be a semi -dog, Dog Korea says, "Don't throw it away, bring it."In a way, I think this method is the best way to prevent organic animals.

Dog Korea prepared a lot about the entire pet life cycle of pet adoption, care, and funeral.You can see people who express some rejection of pets, which are also influenced by the “dog factory” that aired on TV a few years ago.However, if transparency and reliability of growth is secured, the rejection of the sale will gradually disappear.

Dog Korea's pet DNA real name…I think that it will be a new milestone that solves the problem of organic dogs and innovates pet culture.
