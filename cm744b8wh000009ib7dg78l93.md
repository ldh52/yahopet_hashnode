On April 27 (Sat), the theme of the seminar held at the Changbi Institute is 'legislative, budget, change through government organization, how is policy for animals?'The host was organized by the Green Party Animal Rights Commission preparation meeting, animal law comparative research group, and the presentation were Ha Seung -soo, co -chairman of the Green Party.

In this seminar, Ha Seung -soo, the chairman of the Green Party's co -operative committee, was presented to the legislative, budget, and government organization to solve animal rights problems.

▶ How to solve social problems?There is a method of politics and a judicial solution.For example, in solving the problem of same -sex marriage, Germany and New Zealand are solved through parliament, the United States through judicial resolution, and Ireland through referendum.

▶ How to increase the problem of politics?

- Requires for competitive structure between political parties centered on policies ... The proportional representation system is important
- The presence of competent parties representing various values ​​/ agendas
- Political culture, detailed political system

For example, the Netherlands's parliamentary election system is a proportional representative system, and in the Netherlands, there is a list of candidates under the party on the ballot.The people may vote in the party and vote for candidates supported by individuals.The National Assembly members will enter the National Assembly according to the votes gained by the party.

In the Netherlands, large -scale political parties such as Greenlinks also deal with animal policies, but they also deal with animal policies in small political parties such as Party for Animals.Even if the vote of 3.2%of the parliamentary elections can be obtained, 5 out of 150 seats can be secured.

▶ Traps that are easy to fall out of a country where politics does not play a role

- Tend to rely on excessive lawsuits…Not only is progress late, but environmental/animal issues are relatively difficult to solve judicial problems (human -centered judicial systems)
- Tend to cling to legislative lobby for members of the two parties.It may be necessary to solve and improve the current issue right now, but it is impossible to change the direction of a large frame.

▶ We need strategy and roadmap.

- Goal to achieve after 10 years
- The necessary policies and roadmaps…Selection of agenda, how to promote policy means?
- Short -term issue response

▶ What is a policy?

Policy direction…Decision on the problem of the community (common problem)

Example) Will you increase factory livestock?Will you reduce it?Will you get rid of it?

Policy direction is a matter of choice

- After all, the question of what kind of world you want to create
- The space to discuss this direction is politics

▶ What is politics?

- My politics…I am participating in the policy (direction and means) decision
- Our politics
- Politics of the whole society

▶ What are the laws, budgets, plans, and government reorganization?

1. It is a policy means…Means

Example) To reduce factory livestock, the legal system must be changed to reduce factory livestock, and the budget must be organized and invested to be converted into animal welfare livestock, and the stroke should be made for transition.(Budget is one year, planning for more than a few years) and government organizations should be replaced with the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, for example.

2. The difference between the state and the local government

- The state is a centralized system
- In principle, local governments can exercise the regulatory authority within the range of the law, and it is possible to support residents or increase the benefits without delegation.

▶ How to use policy means?

- Do you need laws and ordinances?
- How will you prepare if you need money?
- If it takes a long time, is it necessary to establish a plan?

▶ The policy means are just means.Of course, study is necessary.But you only need to know as much as you need as a citizen.

▶ How will we spread and implement me (us) claims?

- How do you promote citizens?Slogan and message
- How will you move parliamentary/administrative power?
- How will I participate in power?Through political parties, through elections

Lee Sang -soo, Lee Seung -soo, has summarized the announcement of the Joint Steering Committee.

Recently, I attended the 'Animal Hospital Medical Development Policy Discussion Meeting from the Consumer Perspective of the National Assembly, the Policy Debate for Improving Animal Welfare' in Jungnang -gu, policy discussions and the establishment of the Small Business Basic Law.Looking back on the last events, all three events found that they were a way to solve animal rights problems through politics.

In order to implement what you claim, you need a strategy, a roadmap, a budget and a plan.However, there may be animal rights activists who work with pure heart that loves animals without such policy means.I think, 'Today's seminar is a necessary seminar for those people!'

In the case of a seminar in the developed countries of animal welfare, we were able to introduce the 'solving problem through politics' to benchmark.In particular, the Netherlands's parliamentary elections suggests that we can improve our animal welfare."The more political parties centered on the policy, but the more political parties centered on the policy, the political atmosphere that prioritizes animal policy will be formed," Ha Seung -soo said.As he says, I look forward to the Green Party standing as a representative party that reflects the love of animals and lovingly in the policy.
