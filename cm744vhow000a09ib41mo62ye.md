On July 15 (Wed), the Korea Pet Business Association (Chairman Han Sang -deok, hereinafter referred to as the 'Association') and Wonkwang University's pet industry department (Chairman Kim Ok -jin, hereinafter 'Department') were held at Wonkwang University.

The business agreement was attended by pet -related companies, including the Association Chairman Han Sang -deok, Pet Ground, Jay Loy, Atopet, Pet Terriers, and the Era.

The association and department decided to work together for technical advice for the Animal Resource Development Research Center, and joint development and sharing projects that meet market demand.

Kim Ok -jin, chairman of the Korean Society of Animal Mingling, said, “I felt that there is a lot of external expectations for the pet industry.”

The association was founded in December 2018 with the aim of 'protecting the interests of SMEs related to pets and creating public interests.'
