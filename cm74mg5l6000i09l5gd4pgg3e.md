The arched structure Laforesta, a wide lawn in the field of view, caught the eye, and the streams of water are spewed out of the small fountain in front of you.

La Foreta has an indoor and outdoor space, which can be accompanied by dogs.First, take a picture of the interior space.The scenery looking out the window through the indoor window is beautiful.

It is an outdoor space that can be with dogs.It's an arched structure, so it's like having a lawn in front of you.It would not be easy to meet blue grass in the city, but you can see a large lawn.

I met a grandmother who walked out with a dog in the forest of North Seoul.The grandmother and the dog sitting on the bench are kept in the memories, click!

There is a pond called 'Wolyoungji' on the way down to the car with Laforesta.There are various attractions in the forest of North Seoul, such as a pond, such as the waterfall, the Chilsukji, the traditional architectural story garden, and the art center.I think I will come with a good person next time, and I will come with a good person next time.

I arrived at the stop to take the bus.There is a long cat's promotional poster outside the village bus.'Born on the road, but our neighbor' ... Seongbuk -gu Gil Cat is a campaign with a cafe.

It is a breathtaking city center in Seoul.And somewhere in Seoul, there is a dream forest.It was a place where you can walk with your dog, and you can also have tea and meals.When I go to the forest of dreams, my heart is wider and my heart is cool.In May, why don't you feel the freshness of nature with your dog in the forest of North Seoul?
