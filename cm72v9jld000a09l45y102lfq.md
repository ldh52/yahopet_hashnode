Introduction

[Fox and Dolphin] is a performance inspired by the word 'gap'.'Gap' talks about the gaps between visible things, but it also speaks of an invisible time, events and phenomena.We believed that even though we were naturally far away, all beings are related to something, even though they are artificially close, and there is always a gap in between.There is a big and small gap between the loved ones and me, of course, the relationship with someone who thinks it is completely different from me.We thought this 'gap' was like a border between the sea and land.Reminiscent of a fox walking on the land and a dolphin swimming on the sea on the coastline, leaving each other's different appearance, and backing the space where they live.The two creators want to be a fox and a dolphin, facing several phase lodgings in their works.I felt a gap, looked at what the gaps looked like, and made a fox and a dolphin, thinking about what the gap was transferred to other beings.

Contents of the work

When I was so hard, I thought with my heart.I would like to have a person that resembles me on the other side of the place where I was, and I thought that I would wait for me in front of the secret door.Today is the way to meet a child who looks like me.I met, and I had a problem.It's bigger than I thought, and I can't touch it.We probably lived in different flows.It's okay though.Even those who can lose weight are related to being filled with unexpected things when they make a relationship.We believe and give us the energy of our hearts as miracles and visit us.Even if we soon break up, we may meet.
