Kazakhstan's archaeologists discovered a well -preserved cat as they lived in the Silk Road 1,000 years ago and restored the cat with the international research team.

The time when the cat lived was estimated between 775 and 940, which was lived by Turks in Turks.Dijankent, where the ashes were found, were located in an important contact of the Silk Road, which connects Asia and the Mediterranean.

The Oguz people lived in the Middle Ages Central Asia, which are part of Mongolia, Kazakhstan, and Ukibekistan and Turkmenican.

They lived nomadic life and relied on sheep, goats, cows, and horses.Therefore, the discovery of cats is unusual.Because it is not uncommon for people who live nomadic to live with a cat, a real animal.

In the age of farming, a cat may have been needed to catch the rodents that eat grain, but the nomads did not need a cat.

The research through the cat's remains noted that the nomadic people looked back on the cat, and re -examined the lives of the cat through the analysis of physical, genetic and isotope.

DNA analysis shows that this cat has been tamed unlike wild cats.Cats are estimated to have died for a little over a year.

3D images and X-rays show that cats were hurt through the remains, but they were recovered. One strange thing was that there was little cat's teeth.So the cat would not have hunted, and I thought it would have been protected by people.

And according to the isotope analysis, this idea becomes more and more clear, and there was a big difference in protein than dogs and cats that lived in the same era.This means that cats ate meat, not grains or garbage.(A cat with no teeth and no hunting ate people's meat)

As we saw earlier, the cat was not a practical animal at all for the nomads.But for people, it would have been considered a kind of exotic animal, researchers say.

These rare animals, including cats, would have been traded through the Silk Road, where cultural exchanges are carried out.The discovery also shows that trading cats with exotic animals or pets has been around for a long time than when they usually think.

Cat remains are evidence of “changes in human and animal relationships” in this area, the author of the paper says.

The chickens and horses entered the UK 2,200 years ago.But it wasn't food.The chickens and horses were also traded as exotic animals like Dijankent's cats.In addition, ancient British worshiped these animals as they interacted with other gods.It was the reason that chickens and horses were considered to be meat.

We don't know if the Oguz people worship cats in a similar way.This is an interesting task for scientists to find answers.
