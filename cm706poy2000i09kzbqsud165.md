초록

This study aimed to evaluate the differences in canine preferences for pet food terrine* according to the processing method.

* terrine : 테린(잘게 썬 고기·생선 등을 그릇에 담아 단단히 다져지게 한 뒤 차게 식힌 다음 얇게 썰어 전채요리로 내는 음식)

As companion dogs, three male Spitz canines(average age 12years, average weight 7kg) and three male Spitz mix canines(average age 12years, average weight 5kg) were used in Experiment 1, whereas five male(average age 10years, average weight 9kg) and five female Shetland Sheepdogs(Sheltie, average age 10years, average weight 8kg) were used in Experiment 2, to evaluate their preferences and intake types.

In both experiments, all dog categories mostly preferred 'meat' when it came to their first choice of food consumed, followed by 'vegetables', 'mixed eating', and 'vegetable leftover*' last.

* leftover : Usually leftovers. food remaining uneaten at the end of a meal, especially when saved for later use.

This confirms means that canines are carnivores*, and over time, choosing 'vegetables' or 'vegetable leftovers' as a secondary or alternate food source can be considered a natural process.

* carnivores : 육식동물

When provided various terrines, canines in both experiments first ingested 'cooked' rather than 'freeze-dried' duck, chicken, beef, and pork terrines when selecting food at the start of feeding.

For both experiments, most of the intake types using duck, chicken, beef, and pork terrine showed a preference for 'after consuming cooked terrine first and then intake freeze-dried' item.

In conclusion, the reason for preferring cooked terrine can be attributed to the difference in the preparation cooking method of freeze-dried cooked terrine.
