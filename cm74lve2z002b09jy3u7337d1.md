Yoon Kyung Co., Ltd., a company that studies pet residential culture, introduces the 'elements that the pet house should have' on the website.In the Yajoppet, we look at what these elements are.-Addivier Note-

In this article, it is the lighting of the petheim options for pets.

How is the human eye and the eyes of pets different?

The bottom line is that it is difficult to compare either human and pet.People are good for people to work during the day and cats and dogs are also good for night.

​

A person is easy to distinguish the color that is mainly visible during the day.It has a convenient eye to work only during the day.And both eyes are facing forward, so the view overlaps with both eyes is wide, but the entire field of view is narrow.And compared to nymph or dogs, the nose sticks out less, so you can see the things in front of the nose.lol

First, the dog's eyes are bad.Compared to people, it is myopia.

You can only see it in the 30 ~ 60cm range in front of you.And I can't see it when I see something close because my ability to adjust the lens is poor.It is not color blind, but there is little color to see.

​

The good thing is that even in small movements, I can easily notice and move the moving objects.And night vision is good.Occasionally, when you see children at night, it becomes a luminous luminous light from the eyes, which can be seen at night because there is a reflector on the retina.

The cat's eyes are similar to the dog's eyes.For hunting, I had an eye suitable for work at night rather than daytime.There is also a bag of cats, so you can see only 15 percent of the light you need.Also, like a puppy, you can recognize the movement very sensitive.

If you have an example on TV, a person seems to be moving, not just stops 24 photos per second.But for our children, it is still only seen in the picture.

It is usually called the refresh rate, but if you see a TV with a low refresh rate,

For our children, it seems that the pictures continue to change.In the case of dogs, it is more than four times more flicker than humans.

​

The eyes of pets and humans have different structures and characteristics, so this should be considered in residential spaces.

​

It is the century of the first illumination.

Pets can be seen with only 15-20%of human lights.Therefore, in the evening, lighting with subtle indirect lighting or dimes switch function is comfortable.If you have worked in strong sunlight for the day, even if the burdensome light intensity continues at night, it can be burdensome for your eyes.

​

The second blink.

In English, it is called flicker.Nowadays, almost all countries are using exchange electricity.Therefore, if you just have a light, you will continue to feel the shape of light and darkness.This is inevitable for children with sensitive vision.

​

Therefore, when choosing lighting, it is better to have a dimmer switch that can adjust indirect lighting or illuminance rather than direct lighting.

And more importantly, you need a flickering flicker-free flicker.

If you have a flicker at home, you can easily see the video with a slow motion function on your phone.

It is easy to see by shooting a video with a slow motion function on the mobile phone.

These small considerations make it a space for pets and guardians to live comfortably.Guardians need to know well so that they can create a healthy residential environment.
