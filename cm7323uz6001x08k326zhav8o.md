Students who were introduced by the Korean Horse Racing Lecturer Lee Jung -min, who were introduced to the horses, rehabilitation margin, Jangje, riding guidance, horse rider, veterinarians, horse nutritionists, and horsemen, responded that there were so many jobs.

Horse types include racehorse, riding horses, and reverse horses.Gyeongju horses in Gyeongju can only be seen at the Korean Horse Association.That's why I could see the words that were different from the words I had seen here.

Students who were introduced to the horse industry related to the horse industry visited the Korean Horse Association site with the guidance of Lee Jung -min.Saturday, where I visited the Korean Horse Association, was a racing day, so I was able to see the rider and race horse who moved after the game.

After the veterinarians, Jangje, and horsemen managers looked around the actual work, they had a time to interact with the horse with carrots prepared at Masa (Stables).

"Maquip manager, jangja, rider, and assistant teachers are a job that prioritizes technology rather than education. As the horse industry develops, demand for the job continues to increase, but there are not many professional professionals."The instructor explains.In the case of a national certified certificate, Jangjesa says that at least three years is required to take the qualification exam, and must be accumulated even after acquisition.

At first glance, Lee Jung -min, who explains, "It seems easy to put a horses on the horse, but if the nail is wrong, it will lose its value as a horse."I could see how important things were.

Through this field trip, I found out that racing horses were cared for in the game.Instead of competition by grades or academic backgrounds, the jobs of horsemen managers, assistants, riders, and chiefs who compete thoroughly with technology require a lot of effort for skill, but economic rewards are followed.

Mal Industrial Experts Training Institutions include high schools such as Seogwipo Industrial Science High School, Yongun High School, Korea Horse Livestock High School, Balan Bio Science High School, Korea Masa High School, and Korean Horse Industrial High School.There is a university such as.

The tour of the Korean Horse Association was an opportunity to understand the horse industry that was not often encountered by early bird students, and it was a good time to find out that there were various jobs not only in dogs and cats but also in horse -related fields.
