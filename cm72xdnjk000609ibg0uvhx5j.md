On the first day of November, Atret's performance 'See you in front of my house!Meet with the movie, Jazz 'was held in Luoyang Water Love Park.

The performance, which was held three times from October 18, was commented by Kim Ari jazz commentator about jazz music in the film, and the performance team played jazz.The performance of the jazz commentator and listening to the performance on the spot is a feature of this performance.

At the Jamsil Stadium in Seoul, LG and Kiwoom's baseball was held, but the game was delayed on the day.The two hours of jazz music in a sweet movie ... I connect the music called Jazz, which was somewhat unfamiliar with it, to listen to the explanation, and listen to it in the field.

After the performance, we walk around the Luoyang Water Love Park where the performance was held.

Along with the autumn rain, the park feels calm.The crowded autumn leaves in harmony with the green evergreen water are noticed.At the same time, the wings are also on the mobile phone screen.

It was a weather that repeated the rain, but the park was noticeable in the dogs who walked with their dogs.There is a Buyongcheon promenade next to the park, so it seems to have been stopped by the park on the promenade.

You can see the clothes of people walking thickened.I think it's going to be the weather for a white breath soon in my mouth, and I observe the dogs passing by for a while.

Jazz, walking people and dog dogs, autumn leaves, parks that hug all of this ... The music called jazz is harmonized in everyday urban parks.I think, 'I want to see this in harmony with music more often and more, and move home.
