The re -entering measures will be held in September last year for 207 farms in Gimpo, Paju, and Yeoncheon, which had been killed to prevent the spread of ASF in September last year.

The re -entering ceremony is completely passed through the procedures such as 'cleaning and disinfection of farms and external and sterilizing the farm', 'jurisdiction inspection', 'joint inspection', and 'farm evaluation', and then through the approval of the final agricultural and forestry quarantine headquarters.It is sequentially proceeded from a farm without any.

However, in the 10 farms within 500m of ASF and the occurrence area of ​​500m, the farm evaluation and environmental inspection will be conducted if there is no abnormality after the 60 -day farm pig test.

Accordingly, the province formed a public -private joint inspection team, including the Agricultural Forestry and Livestock Quarantine Headquarters, City County, and Pork Experts, to carefully check the conditions of defense facilities and disinfection and washing conditions of the farmers, and to closely examine the detection of viruses inside and outside farms.Plan.

In accordance with the Revision of the Enforcement Regulations Enforcement Rules of Livestock Infectious Disease Prevention Act, the farmers must make facilities according to the reinforced facility standards such as internal and external fences, assistant and prevalence, defense rooms, all rooms, disinfection facilities, livestock waste storage facilities, and exemption and exit.You have to have it.

Above all, he actively participated in the killing to prevent the spread of ASF, but decided to actively support farmers' recovery by strengthening the defense facility by organizing a budget of 3.9 billion won for pig farms who lost their income base because they could not breed pigs.In addition, the government plans to suggest additional national funding to help farmers recover.

In addition, since it is difficult to enter the pigs that are living in the northern part of Gyeonggi, we will take various measures to ensure that pigs can be re -entered smoothly, such as installing a reinforcement reinforcement transshipment.

Earlier, in September, the city, along with municipal counties, pigs and experts, held a pre -prevention session for farmers twice and guided the defense facility that must be installed mandatory before entering.

In addition, the Handon Association, the Society of the Water Society, and the Strengthen Defense Facility Standards, “Mandatory Duty Facility Application House,” was held to provide regional education to improve farmers' understanding and listen to the difficulties related to the re -entry ceremony.

Choi Kwon -rak, the head of the Animal Protection Division, said, “The farmers themselves check the checklists themselves, and the farm -centered thorough prevention management will be achieved.”We will not be able to stand. ”
