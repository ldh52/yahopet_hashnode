On Children's Day on May 5, I searched for 'Hongcheon Dog' on Naver.More than half had been there, but the place I noticed was the 'sweet camping site'.On the first day of the holiday, I spend this morning and leave the house until lunch.Leave it! Starting from home, entering a camping site and driving the car.I thought I would go to the campsite by passing through Donghongcheon IC and going to the camping ground, but I drove from Cheoljeong Intersection to Naechon from Cheoljeong Intersection, and followed the Navi in ​​the direction of Naechon.I was able to arrive at the camping ground.

Park park your car, take a tour of the camping ground and take a picture.The first landscape of the campsite ... The Hongcheon River is flowing before the front of the camps and the mountain behind is a cozy look.The glamping site was seen on the left side of the entrance.The neatly tidy figure is impressive.

Considering the water, the little grass, the small pool contains hot water, and maintained the body temperature.

The guests kept visiting and were busy, but they kindly introduced and interviewed the campsite, and he said he was a music director before.

After the boss interview, take a picture of the glamping site.Although not often, my family does not like camping because my family was with my wife after camping.Such a wife says this.

"Will we come to play next time?"

I liked the clean tent and well -prepared kitchen tools, and most of all, I didn't have to clean up after camping.

As I sat in a glamping chair, I wanted to sit down and didn't want to get up.As the boss said, I felt like I came to a quiet fortress in the mountains.I think this is a healing, and people who came with their dogs today did not meet.However, if you keep pet tickets, you will be able to enjoy the wonderful nature with your dog, heal and spend time with your dog.It was a street that can come in one hour in Seoul, clear and clear water, and sweet camping grounds.
