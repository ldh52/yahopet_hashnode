Furniture used in common houses is, of course, furniture for guardians, or people.

The height of the chair and desk, the width and height of the stairs, and the height of the sink are made on the basis of people.However, Petheim, caring for pets, naturally considers pets as well as guardians.

The reason why furniture (interior) considering pets is as follows.

The necessity of households considering pets

First, ensure the safety of pets.

The furniture in the house is made very convenient for humans, but it can cause a dangerous situation for pets.

The table or desk with glass is clean management for guardians, but it may cause injuries to fall due to slipping for pets.In the case of a five -stage bookshelf, the cats go up to three trials, but sometimes they fall up to it.

In these people's daily lives, things that feel like trivial can make pets more dangerous than wild environments.

Effectively utilizing pets' safety, stress relief, and space

Second, reduce the stress of pets.

For pets, the house is a very narrow space.You should be able to solve your own habits and instinctive needs.

In the case of cats, it is necessary to design a vertical space with horizontal space to reduce stress.In addition, the space for children to hide on its own is psychologically stable.

Third, you can effectively use the space with your guardians.

In life, luggage (?) For pets will increase.If you have the necessary things such as cannels, houses, cat towers, cat wheels, feeding supplies, bowel movements, bath supplies, and various home appliances, it will increase and change to a cramped house instead of a comfortable house.

The interior built-in is maximized for spatial efficiency.In addition to the space where pets can be active, the guardian's life satisfaction also increases.

Furniture and interiors for pets have things that must be observed.

As it is a direct contact with our children, it should be an eco -friendly material as much as possible.For example, in the case of a dog, if the furniture is biting with the mouth, it may cause abnormal health if it is made of an unknown material.

As such, furniture that considers pets can be divided into several ways.

First, it is a pet play facility.

Although it is called a play facility, it ensures an activity space suitable for the habits of pets.This includes a cat tower, a catwork, and a pet door.

Second, it is a living facility for pets.

There are furniture containing our children's homes, bowel movements connected to external ventilation, dedicated passage connected to the outside, pet run entrance, and emergency connections that can be used in case of emergency.

Third, it is a convenience facility for guardians.

The space that stores the pet supplies inside the house is connected to the pet -only facilities.On the first floor, it is a pet house, connection, cabinet, and baths containing bath supplies, and external storage warehouses that can store walking goods or car supplies.

When designing these furniture or interior items, the target pet must be considered.These small furniture and props make it possible to create a safer and satisfactory residential space for pets and guardians.
