The square gallery I visited late in the afternoon ... I told the official that I came to see the fall before I finished the tour.It wasn't long before Kang Ji -hye arrived at the gallery.

Kang Ji -hye writer ... I'm as nice as that.He greeted him and heard about his work.

What did you think for the first time?Personally, I thought it looked like a puppy when I first saw that.Let's listen to the artist's story about that.

That fall

"That's the person who wrote a fox. I was tricked in the world, and I had a lot of trouble.

▶ A person who wants to be clever like a fox ...

Kunyi

"Kun is a puppy who lives in my sister's house. I sometimes meet when I go to play.

▶ A dog that only shows a happy figure ... Kun is Mr..

Kang Ji -hye said, "This year, I did the work that expresses the happiest moments of people through that year. I was happy to see it."

That Naknak

"It's a name that was born from the idea of ​​'let's change something', just as the fox masked to be clever."The order of thinking about the fall is ...

1. Remove 'Kang' from the name 'Kang Ji -hye'.→ 2. Return the river back and forth.→ 3. The birth of the GNAK (GNAK)

After removing the last name from his name, the name was reversed and reversed.'That Nakak' ... It is a name that goes well with the fox mask.Listening to the character of the character, it becomes more lovely.

This year's Christmas was not white Christmas, but I met a wonderful 'garden' in the square gallery, so it was a day when you received a great memory as a gift.

In the old days, there is a word '有 朋 遠 不 不 不 不 不 乎', which means, 'Is it not fun to come from a distance?'As if I met a long -time friend, I met with Nak and Kun today.

In the evening of the dark Christmas, he will continue to meet with Mr. Nak and Kun.
