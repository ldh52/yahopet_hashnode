While reading a post on the medical/diagnostic records uploaded by the Holpet Caf√© member of a chronic disease disease, I thought that the minds and systems of veterinarians in Korea and veterinarians in Hong Kong were very different.

In the second veterinary clinic in Korea, I couldn't hand over the data I had treated for the dog.Of course, even if the original cannot be given, the copy is the right of a consumer that can be fully required.I gave my money and treated my dog, and I asked for a copy of the treatment process.I think I should file a lawsuit against the veterinarian.It's not just asking for a copy of the chart to get advice from other veterinarians in the United States.

Let's take an example of Hong Kong.This time, a friend's nyan was closed to flutd and was hospitalized.X-ray, blood test, and urine tests were done, and the veterinarian kindly read X-ray and explained the results of blood tests/urine tests.And if you have a treatment in the future, and if the prognosis is not good after that treatment, it will be explained in detail for about 20 minutes.I would like to take a CBC test because I would like to review the wbc figures.(The next day, the CBC inspection came out and the WBC level was high. So we agreed that the cause of the urinary tract was stressful cystitis.

Ask for the results of the X-ray and blood/urine tests, so I put X-ray photos on the CD (see the picture above).I also received blood and urine test results.

And I was surprised to see the bill (photo below) on the day of discharge.It is recorded in detail what medicine/sap was prescribed by date, and what kind of treatment you have done, and the price for each medical service is detailed in detail.It was not a receipt, but a tradement chart.Hong Kong Animal Hospital, which provides this detailed information for consumers who are not interested in and knowing, and some of Korea's animal hospitals that ignore this information request, which is the right of consumers.

Developed countries are not just because they have a high national income per capita (about $ 32,000 in Hong Kong and $ 20,000 in Korea).I think that it is only a society where everything can be done in common sense.In this regard, Korea is not yet developed.How do you join Korea's OECD and enter the ranks of developed countries.In the national life, all of these things are not solved in common sense, all of them are air fluoride.
