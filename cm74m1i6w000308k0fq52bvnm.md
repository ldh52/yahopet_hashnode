The Rural Development Administration (CEO Hur Tae -woong) announced that it has developed the technology necessary for the integrated pet crisis management service in collaboration with Dongguk University and Unimeo.

The pet crisis management integrated service -based technology is a technology that can support lost animals, adoption dogs, and hospitals as one information management operating system (platform*).

* Patent Application: 10-2018-0136479, Big Data-based pet crisis management integration system, server and method (2018.11.08)

Lost dog search technology required for pet crisis management*, dog nose pattern (inscription) recognition technology*, dog adoption recommendation model, and hospital recommendation technology are installed in the integrated service information management operation system.

* Patent application: 10-2019-015-5040, scale-based classification device for matching loss dogs and loss dogs (2019.11.28)

* Patent application: 10-2018-0160903, dog's biometric information recognition device (2018.12.13)

Lost dog search technology is a technology that uses a lost dog's picture to find an individual with similar appearance among individuals registered as lost and organic animals.As a result of using artificial intelligence technology, it showed about 70%accuracy.

The dog's nose pattern recognition technology is a technology that checks the individual when using the animal hospital, using a nose pattern information similar to the human fingerprint.

As a result of applying artificial intelligence, the dog's nose pattern recognition technology showed more than 99% of individual identification accuracy.

Nose pattern recognition technology, which is based on biometric information, can increase the reliability of individual confirmation and connect with pet insurance.

Recommended models of dogs are recommended as a characteristic of dogs that are advantageous for adoption success by analyzing more than 300,000 cases of adoption of dogs registered in the Animal Protection Management System (APMS*).

* Patent application: 10-2018-016-1367, adoption recommendation system and method by matching dog characteristics and masters of the owner (2018.12.13)

* Integrated management system for animal protection, such as animal registration, organic animal reporting, and farm animal welfare

In case of reflecting the characteristics of the dog and the preference of the companion, the success rate of adoption was more than 70%.

The hospital recommendation technology provides a veterinary clinic based on the location of the dog and the medical course information.
