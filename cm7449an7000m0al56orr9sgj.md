The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Livestock Quarantine Headquarters (Director Park Bong -kyun, hereinafter referred to as “Quarantine Headquarters”) produces Korean foot -and -mouth disease vaccine prototypes*and conducts quality evaluation tests.* It is a test product produced on a smaller scale than this production size (ton) to conduct various tests such as vaccine efficacy evaluation.

(Major Research Performance)

The Quarantine Headquarters developed 15 kinds of foot -and -mouth disease vaccine seed virus*from 2017 to 2020 and kept it in Korea's Ui -Ui Resources Bank.* Seed virus: Virus made suitable for vaccine production

Therefore, the quarantine headquarters produced a prototype of the foot -and -mouth disease 2 -ga vaccine (O type Boeunju + A Yeoncheonju) using its own vaccine research facility (100ℓ).

Among the trials for licensing foot -and -mouth disease vaccines, the rest of the items except clinical trials can be carried out as non -clinical requests*, so that the vaccine prototype was produced using the research facility held by the quarantine headquarters before the establishment of the foot -and -mouth disease vaccine factory.* Non -clinical samples do not require an animal drug manufacturing and quality control standard (KVGMP) facility.

Foot -and -mouth disease O -type Boeunju and A -type Yeoncheonju are made using viruses separated from Korea, so it can be called a Korean foot -and -mouth disease vaccine.In recognition of the value as a vaccine, the findings were published in the International Journal of Antiviral Research (September 2020).* Defense against the major viruses of the Asian fashion (SEA, ME-SA, Cathay)

In addition, Type A Yeoncheonju showed equal efficacy with the A22 IRQ vaccine, which is widely used worldwide.

In particular, the prototype vaccine minimizes the local reaction of the inoculation site by reducing the inoculation volume from 2ml to 1ml, and the development of the vaccine (muscle abnormalities) is expected to be significantly improved through future technology development.

The foot -and -mouth disease vaccine prototype will be produced as a commercial vaccine after a number of additional exams such as virus defense effects, immune duration checks, and safety assessments.

Meanwhile, the quarantine headquarters invited livestock officials at Daejeon Inter City Hotel on November 20 in relation to the production of foot -and -mouth disease vaccine prototypes, and held a symposium on the theme of “The present and future of domestic foot -and -mouth disease vaccine development”.

The Quarantine Headquarters announced the development of prototypes and listened to the opinions of experts on domestic foot -and -mouth disease vaccines.

Park Jong -hyun, head of the Vaccine Research Center, Quarantine Headquarters, said, “The first Korean foot -and -mouth disease vaccine in Korea has a wide range of defense against various regional viruses and has a technology that can reduce muscle damage to the inoculation site.It can be introduced as a more improved vaccine than a foreign vaccine, ”he said.“ It will be a competitive product that can not only localize foot -and -mouth vaccines that depended on imports. ”
