- Introduction of a series of procedures to help those planning to adopt overseas
- Overseas adoption progresses after thoroughly prepared so that dogs with experienced dogs will not be rebounded twice.

('199) On February 25, Gray Hound Kara and Whipett Laurie were adopted to the United States.Kara and Lori were adopted to San Francisco, USA, who were rescued by the Korea Border Collie Rescue Association.

Kara and Lori go to the United States and accompany the Kwon Revolutionary Revolutionary Representative of the Korea Border Coley Rescue Association.

First, I stopped by the Maruan Animal Hospital and confirmed the health of Kara and Lori.The association conducts a health examination immediately after the structure of the organic dog.Even after the health examination, the health of the organic dogs will be steadily managed, and the health test will be conducted once again before departure.If the departure is in the afternoon, it is inspected to be able to board the plane before leaving the airport.The health examination certificate is valid for 10 days, and if possible, it is more trusted and relieved from overseas to receive the day before departure or the day of departure, and Lori conducted the inspection at Maruan Animal Hospital in the morning and afternoon.

After arriving at the airport, the animal quarantine station examines whether the dog and documents to be departed are once again based on the veterinarian's health medical certificate, and if it is determined that it is right, it confirms the passport of the moving volunteer to board and issues an animal quarantine certificate written in English.

If the departure is early in the morning, you can go to the Animal Quarantine Station (Incheon Airport or Seoul Deungchon -dong Quarantine Headquarters) a day before, or you can make a reservation on the Internet in advance.

Below is a floor animal hospital.When you come to the veterinary hospital, there is a cat named 'Mango'.Gray Hound Kara sees a mango and does not respond much.Looking at this, five cats and organic dogs live together, and there is no big problem in living together.

Check the health status at the veterinary hospital

When the association asked how to rescue the organic dogs, "If the announcement is posted at the organic animal shelter, we will rescue the association before the end of the euthanasia, and to contact the organization or individual who wishes to adopt overseas with the rescue."Answer.

Overseas adoption, "Some animal rights groups that promote overseas adoption or a small number of people who are promoting overseas adoption are promoting overseas adoption by informing them of dogs that will be killed by food dogs through SNS.It is gradually decreasing, and many people do not eat dog meat, but when foreign people see this, our country is still seen as a 'dog meat eating country' and 'pet culture backward country'. "

Rescue dog farm dogs is not wrong.However, it is not desirable to decrease our pet culture by focusing on these dogs, but it is not desirable to decrease our pet culture.

Kwon says that the Korean Border Coley Rescue Association is adopted overseas."The Korea Border Collie Rescue Association is promoting overseas adoption for dogs that can no longer be adopted in Korea. In addition, thorough health care and education, they are adopted overseas, and they do not cause people to be adopted or irritating people.. "

Kwon's words can be understood by seeing Kara and Lori ahead of adoption.When I went to the veterinary hospital or before I was on the plane, when I walked the road, I did not respond to the dogs and people around me, and when I entered the house, I did not respond to the cat.

After preparing for the quarantine documents, carry Kara and Lori in the vehicle.I usually use pet taxis, but today I can't make a reservation for a pet taxi, so I go to the airport using the airport call van.

After confirming the health of Kara and Lori, the water bottle was installed in the plane moving cage, and the blanket was laid on the floor.The thickness of the blanket is also defined, which is to prevent the 'banned item' in the blanket or underneath.

It wasn't long after preparing for the departure, and a moving volunteer arrived.Kara and Lori are moving to the United States while they are going to the United States.After the quarantine staff confirmed the passport of the mobile volunteer, the animal quarantine certificate was issued in English.

After meeting with a moving volunteer at the quarantine station, the group, including Kara, Lori, and Kwon, headed for a traveler.Here, he measured the weight of Kara and Lori along with the departure procedure of the mobile volunteer.

After the departure procedure, he moves to the place where he loads the luggage with Kara and Lori.Finally, put a network on the cage and seal it with a tape.

All preparations for boarding are over.Today, four are adopted to the United States with the same airplane.Kwon CEO also observes the two health of the two.Kwon says he has learned how important it is to check his health while sending overseas adoption for a long time.Usually, when adopting overseas, only the pet taxi or call vans can be used to carry an adoptive dog, and since then, a series of processes are often done by the driver."I think it would be nice for people to come to the road and the departure process at the airport, and it would be nice for the officials to come and watch together." Kwon says.

The airport employees were moved to the boarding area.Kara, Lori, and the other two dogs were included through the 'resident -only entrance door'.You will then go to the plane and get to San Francisco, USA, and will meet a new owner and live a new life.

I arrived at Incheon International Airport today, and I was able to see a woman who met from the quarantine station until the last minute.As a result, it is said that he is adopted abroad personally.Even for a while, they do not take their eyes off the dog they have been.Looking at it, Kwon says, "Personal rescuers are responsible for adopting adoption, and I think that if you watch it, you think that you are really good people."

In the case of Kara and Lori, Kwon checked his health and adopted it abroad by checking his health for about two months at home.The United States prepared with carefully carefully carefully careful careful care for each one needed to adopt overseas, such as deciding on bowel movements to prevent defecation in the cage on the road.

Dogs that have been educated with such meticulous interest and love are all well -being overseas.Shouldn't I say that the parents' hearts of marriage and marriage of their daughters or sons are Kwon's heart?From the moment I left the house to the moment I left, all the nerves of Kwon Dae -pyo focused on Kara and Lori.

Kwon says with Kwon, who came to Incheon Airport.

"This is to open the procedure for adoption and quarantine documents to help those who are planning to adopt overseas. If you need help with overseas adoption, I will help you at any time."

If you need help with overseas adoption, you can contact KakaoTalk.(ID: Usekwon7)

Kwon wants to tell that our pet culture is not a dog meat culture, and Kwon is adopted abroad by thoroughly managing the dogs that people really need.In the words of Kwon Dae -pyo's words that the dogs with the experienced Payang would not be able to live again and live a happy life, he could see his philosophy of pet culture and organic animals.

'The organic dogs who have ended their lives with euthanasia to live a loved life as a dog!'

Isn't it a rule for people who rescue, impose, and adopt organic animals?
