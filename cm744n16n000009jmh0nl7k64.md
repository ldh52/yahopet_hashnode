We will look at the reality of the pet industry with the implementation of regulations announced by the Small and Medium Venture Business Department.

On November 27 (Fri), the Small and Medium Venture Business Department announced the regulatory sandbox* performance, major achievements, approval companies, and future plans under the title of 'Change of National Lives made by Regulatory Protection'.

* A system that supports various products and services to the market by deferring or exempting regulations to test innovative new technologies under certain conditions

The main contents are '364 cases of approval within two years of implementation, and 166 of them (46%) gained vitality.There are many changes that touch the skin of the people, such as electronic bills, shared beauty salons, and electrocardiograms.

The reporter looked at how much regulatory sandbox tasks related to pets were among the announcements of the Small and Medium Venture Business Department.As a result, pets related to pets include 'Animal Welfare -Friendly Farm' by Pungnyeon Farm, Natus Pin's 'Pet Animal Transport Platform Service using Rent -A -Car', and Small Ticket's Reward Community Platform for Pet InsuranceThree tasks, including the service, were found.This is the ratio of 0.008%out of 364 cases.

Looking at the announcement of the Small and Medium Venture Business Department, I think about the pet industry that overlaps.

A group representing the pet industry

Among the pet industry -related organizations, the most common groups of government policies are the Korea Pet Industrial Retail Association and the Korea Pet Industrial Export Association.Recently, the Korea Pet Business Association has been active in the pet fair.

The Korea Pet Industrial Retail Association represents the interests of small business owners such as pet shops, and the Korea Pet Industrial Export Association is supporting domestic companies entering overseas markets.In addition, the Korea Pet Business Association represents the position of domestic pet companies.

Korea Pet Industrial Retail Association

On August 9, 2019, the Korea Pet Industry Association and the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy jointly held the 'FTA Utilization Company Meeting'.The entrepreneurs who worked in the pet industry talked about their difficulties, and the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy announced the results of the meeting on September 2 and the FTA Comprehensive Support Center website.

The 'Meeting of the FTA Use of the Pet Industry', which was jointly held by the Korea Pet Industry Association and the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy

The meeting hosted by the Korea Pet Industry and Retail Association was about the use of the FTA, but it is encouraging in that the difficulties of businessmen were discussed.

However, since the Korea Pet Industrial Retail Association represents the interests of small business owners such as pet shops, there are many parts of the animal rights group.It is showing a distinct position from these animal rights groups in the animal birth industry and animal sales business.In addition, the Korea Pet Industrial Retail Association, which is fighting to prevent the penetration of large corporations to protect the alleys, is a member of the Small Business Association.

As such, the Korea Pet Industrial Retail Association is in an environment where you have to fight with animal rights organizations and large corporations to keep the livelihood of small business owners such as pet shops.

The Korea Pet Industrial Export Association is striving to strengthen the export capacity of SMEs.The government announced government policies and support related to export, and introduces it through seminars.It provides various information related to exports, but there are not many companies that are focusing on exports in Korea.As more companies are interested in exports to pet sectors, I think that the activities and status of the Korea Pet Industrial Export Association will increase.

On July 15, the Korea Pet Business Association signed a business agreement with the Department of Pet Industry, Wonkwang University.The Korea Pet Business Association aims to protect the rights of its members and is intended to lead the right pet industry culture.

The purpose of the association to protect the interests of member companies is only applicable to members.As a result, there is a gene that has no choice but to friction among the non -subscribers of the association.Examples are the difference between members of the pet fair.

The topic thrown into the pet industry

In the pet industry, the absolute stronger is a feed company.In addition, veterinarians and animal drug organizations that operate animal hospitals will also be strong, and animal organizations form a power group due to opposition.

The reporter saw the contents of the 'regulatory probation' published by the Small and Medium Venture Business Department and said that the pet industry mentioned above was overlapped.Each one has difficulties and has regulations to solve, and it is not found in the approval tasks presented by the Small and Medium Venture Business Department.

The meeting for the launch of the Korea Pet Industry Association

Last year, Chairman Lee Ki -jae, chairman of the Korea Pet Industry Association, held its first meeting for the launch of the Korea Pet Industrial Association (tentative name, hereinafter referred to as the Federation), which encompasses domestic pet -related industrial workers, but attendees could not narrow each other's positions.Since then, the meeting has been defeated.

While the pet industry workers have not gathered opinions, 'Regulatory probation' has been approved by its own companies that do not belong to these associations.It also only three tasks of 0.008%of the total ...

Wouldn't it be possible for pet industrial workers to see their problems from the government if they now turn to the government's policies?Isn't the reality that is currently in now?

If there is a frustrating reality that is blocked by regulations, it is time to gather wisdom to suspend or exempt regulations.

The Small and Medium Venture Business Department's 'regulatory probation' ... "Shouldn't the companies that need to benefit the next benefit should be pet industrial companies?"This is a buzzword where a reporter throws into the pet industry.
