Evenflo, designer, manufacturer, and marketer of infant and children's products, announces the launch of the Pivot® Troop™ Child and Pet Modular Travel System, America's first modular child and pet travel system designed to fit the whole family.

Seamlessly integrating the needs of both children and pets into one product, this innovation is a unique addition to Evenflo's popular Pivot® collection.

With this new offering, families will no longer need to leave their furry pets behind.
