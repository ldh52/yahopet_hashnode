In 2019, the literature 'Animal and Happy', which was organized by Konkuk University, was held.It is a series of lectures, which are companions that both people and animals could think of a happy coexistence.-Addivier Note-

On September 24 (Tuesday), there was a lecture at Konkuk University Life Science Museum, a lecture by Koh Kyung -sun.The theme of the lecture was the meaning of the true 'accompaniment' in movies and literature.

First, let's look at the introduction of the lecture.

Regardless of the East and the West, the narrative structure of 'the relationship between humans and animals' was introduced through various literature and films.Their complex and intense appearances are sometimes friendly and friendly, and sometimes they are with us because of the inconvenience of threatening my life.When we capture the realistic problems faced in it, we will have the opportunity to explore what true 'accompaniment' is.

The Ko Kyung -sun instructor divided the lectures by dividing the three subtopters, such as 'various families, the death of pets, the sorrow of the left, and the realm of life.'

What is a family?

So various families ... we looked at the meaning of pets given to us.△ What is a family?△ Can a robot be a pet?△ The missing animal lovers have made us think about what pets make today.

▶ 'What is a family?'

Many meanings in the film 'My Brother' and Park Heung -sik's short film 'Family' touched the chest.

In the movie 'My Brother', the dogs and cats that adults look at are animals, but children show that they look at pets like their brothers, and in the family, everyone acts at the time of the house of the dog.He showed a dog.

Dogs who had to go down to the countryside with their mother's birth, and the dogs who were alone while everyone were empty.

▶ Can a robot be a family?

The instructor Koh Kyung -sun showed an Aibo -related video, which was about the joint funeral of the robot dog Aibo.

Can a robot be a family?

Aibo has been suspended in 2006 since it was sold in 1999.As a result, the supply of parts was stopped, and people were difficult to repair.The people who were with Aibo used the word 'treatment', not 'repair', and held a joint funeral for Aibo, which was impossible to treat.

Another video contained the content of a person living with Aibo.The story of a woman in the video saying, "It's a big meaning just to be next to you."

"Can a robot be a pet?"Well, what do you think?

▶ The missing animal love

We looked at the animal lovers in Lee Ki -young's novel 'Myoja'.The tomb means 'adopting a cat in both.'

The main characters Kim Joong -ho and Madam (inside and outside) are the rich who run the company, and the cats in the novel are 'baby'.The protagonists are not specially loved or adopted by both.If you put a person into a man, there is a risk of tearing money, so the animal is in both.

The main characters and outside the protagonist will take care of the households 'March' and the workers.Forces and workers are treated worse than cats.The end of the novel ends with the death of 'baby'.But inside and outside the protagonist don't feel sorrowful about the death ...

Listening to the novel, I was bitterly seen by seeing such a human being.The symbol of wealth and the symbol of power, thinking about pets ... Hyundai goes one step further, and human beings think of pets as a means for profit.

It was a novel written in 1932, but it seemed to be a bit hot as it seemed to be penetrating human nature across the times.If you parody this with comedy or gag, it's probably a sharp thorn in the laughter.

What does pets mean to us?

Konkuk University's companion literature 'The meaning of the true' accompaniment 'in movies and literature' ... I was asking us through a short time what the pet means.What is our family, a pet, what do we accept pets?

It is true that you truly understand them and think about whether you are considering and taking care of the surrounding environment related to pets.
