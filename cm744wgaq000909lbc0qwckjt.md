This symposium is a place that shares information on domestic and foreign animal sympathy and thinks about developing plans.

Animals that have long lived with humanity have developed social ties with human beings.As the population of pets increases, the atmosphere of sympathizing with the interaction between humans and animals is spreading, and the interest and demand for animal sympathy is increasing as animals are recognized as a joy to life.

It is very important to support policies that strengthen social values ​​so that the people can live as a healthy and happy member of the society, and to improve the quality of life of the people.

Recently, as the value of healing of animals and plants has emerged, healing agriculture is attracting attention as a new growth engine for agricultural and rural areas.

At the National Livestock Science Institute, the livestock technology innovation with the people set the vision of creating future value, and the existing traditional livestock industry is solidified and the area of ​​animal value is expanded to lay the foundation for new areas such as pets and healing.

This symposium will be a valuable place to build a network and set the direction of development strategy through professional cooperation.

Throughout the opening company, the National Institute of Livestock Science says it will expand the area of ​​animal value to new areas such as pets and healing.It is nice to see that it will expand its scope to pets and healing in national institutions that combine livestock and science.

▶ The progress of the times when AAI has been developed and settled, the definition of anime-assisted intervention (AAI), AAI's various areas, AAI future, new leap of AAI, cost/benefit balanceChoice

Professor Pine explains the process that AAI has developed by the times, and that the methods and standards that can be scientifically measured should be developed, and the welfare of the therapy animal should be paid.

The know -how that I thought and felt for 43 years in this field was in the presentation, and it was a high level of presentation that thought of the past, present, and future of AAI.

If Professor Fine explained the comprehensive part of AAI, the follow -up Professor, who introduced recent studies in Anthrozoology.

▶ Professor Marshall experimented with two cases, one of which is 'perceived aggressive Tendencies of, and Functional Attitudes Towards, Various Breeds of Dogs' Usal of Dog Breed Names Can Affect CognitiveProcesses'.

In the first case, the experiment was that the participants looked at the dog online and gave them a score to the question about the breed.The experiment began with the assumption that 'aggressive breeds would be less preferred by people' and obtained 90%of the results.This is the result of using three elements: Behaviors, Desire, and Experience used to analyze the results in the experiment.

The content of the second experiment is fun.If you hear the word 'fit bull terrier', what words do you think of these two words?Perhaps most of the people who know about Pitbul are aggressive.In this area, the second experiment was about why.

▲ Case 1: In the moment, it shows a dog's photograph (bright and angry and angry), and chooses a word that matches the picture (Glad, Rude).And measure the time it takes to choose the word.(The result was the shortest time to see the dogs with a pleasant expression and to choose to be fun, and it was the longest time to see the angry appearance and to choose.)

▲ Case 2: Then, this time, the name of the breed is shorter, and then the next screen will select Unpleasant and plesant.In this case, it was the shortest time to choose a 'gentle dog' as 'pleasant', and it was the longest time to choose unpleasant for one gentle dog.

In summary of the results of the second experiment…

- Case 1: Short reactions (positive -positive), long reactions (negative -positive)
- Case 2: Short reactions (positive -positive), long reactions (positive -negative)

There is a difference in the time it takes to see the words, the words, and to recognize things.It is difficult to see the dogs (negative) and think that it is a 'no -ae (positive)', and listen to the gentle 'Golden Retriever', and this dog is difficult to think of 'aggressive'.word…It seems to be a natural phenomenon, and the process of scientifically organizing it and finding the cause is fun.

Professor Pine and Marshall answered the participants' questions after the presentation
