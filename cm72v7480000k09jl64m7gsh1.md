Animals are also painful due to the new corona virus infection (Corona 19).Due to the owner's house, pets have increased time to stay in the house, which causes pets that show abnormal behavior such as anorexia.

Yongsan -gu, Seoul, Seoul, will carry out a nasal (online) education, “Senseful Pet Life,” to protect pets in the corona era.
