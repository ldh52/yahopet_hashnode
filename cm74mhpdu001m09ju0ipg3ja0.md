Looking around the work, one of the Avicinian cats accompany the exhibition.It seems that the fun is doubled by watching with the cat at an exhibition with the theme of cats.

If you look around the room, you will soon find out why Violet Cafe is a complex culture and art space.The vintage interior and the appearance of Buam -dong, which appears out of the window, are inspired by the temple.

I first stopped by Buam -dong, and there is a walking course recommended by Seoul City, and there are Yoon Dong -ju Literature Museum and Creative Gate.Buam -dong, where we can feel our old culture and the breath of Yun Dong -ju poet.I also met a cat who greeted a strange guest while looking around the neighborhood.

After walking around Buam -dong, the sun goes down.It is a dinner time, heading to Moms Kitchen, which was recommended by the representative of the Violet Cafe.Mamki Ski is on the first floor of the Violet Flower Cafe building and is run by two Japanese.

The food of Mom Ski is also a good taste.I can see a book on my side when I eat.

It was a book by Hong Ji -ji, published in 'Buam Guest House'.Hongji also lives in Buam -dong, but now he is traveling.'aha!I met a cat earlier, but there are people here in Buam -dong. '

I met a book with a picture of a cat at a restaurant I visited by chance.The meeting with the artist leaves Moms Kitchen later.

I went to see Kim Ha -yeon's 'Unchil Kisam' exhibition, and I was able to meet the scene where the old culture and art breathe in Buam -dong.It was Buam -dong, where you can meet the Creative Moon, Yoon Dong -ju Literature Museum, Seoul City Recommended Walk Course, and Unchil Kisam Exhibition at once.
