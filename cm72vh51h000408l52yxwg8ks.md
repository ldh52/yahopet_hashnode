The government will continue to monitor and supervise illegal activities such as illegal batteries of e -cigarettes, illegal imports of nicotine, tobacco sales and advertising for liquid e -cigarettes.

The Ministry of Health and Welfare announced that it will announce the promotion of the Liquid E -Tobacco Safety Management Measures announced on October 23 last year, continuously promoting legal basis for liquid -type e -cigarette safety management, and maintaining the recommendation to stop the use of liquid e -cigarettes.

Last year, the Ministry of Health and Welfare recommended the suspension of liquid e -cigarettes as a result of lung damage and death cases related to the use of liquid electronic cigarettes in the United States and similar suspicion cases in Korea.

In the meantime, the government has established a legal basis for resolving the blind spot and strengthening the management system, and the 20th National Assembly was discussed with the amendment to the Tobacco Project Act and the National Health Promotion Act.

However, the 21st National Assembly will submit an amendment to the Tobacco Business Act, which prescribes the expansion of cigarettes and mandatory submission of ingredients, and will continue to make efforts for this law.

Meanwhile, as a result of collecting suspicion of liquid electronic cigarettes for the survey of the lung -type e -cigarettes, there was no report on the case of acute abandonment, such as the case of lung damage of liquid -type electronic cigarettes in the United States within that period.

In addition, 112 liquid -type electronic cigarettes in Korea were also conducted, and 6 kinds of suspected severe lung injury and component analysis of nicotine were conducted.

As a result, vitamin E acetate was detected 0.03 ~ 0.12ppm from three products, three kinds of flavored substances were detected in eight products, and the propylene glycol and glycerin used as a solvent were detected in all products.

In addition, in the discharge (tobacco smoke), vitamin E acetate was detected, and in the case of three kinds of flavored materials and solvents, the detection amount was less than the liquid phase.

In particular, in the case of the liquid nicotine, the content shown in the product is not accurate, and the display method is also varied by Mg, %, Mg/ML, etc.

In addition, the cell survival rate decreases at some concentrations in the case of propylene glycol, glycerin, and influential substances as a result of the cell toxicity test to identify the human harmfulness of the suspicion of lung damage.The back toxicity was confirmed.

Experimental animal suction toxicity test (4 types) resulted in respiratory toxicity.

In the experimental animal suction toxicity test (4 types), the respiratory toxicity was confirmed at the concentration of propylene glycol (826 mg/kg) and vitamin E acetate (3.125 mg/kg).

However, compared to the confirmed concentration, the exposure estimates of the human body calculated by the detection of propylene glycol and vitamin E acetate in domestic distribution products were low.

In summary, the government explained that cases similar to acute waste damage that occurred in the United States in 2019 were not received in Korea, and such cases were unlikely to occur in Korea.

However, since this study was conducted in only seven ingredients in the short term from October 2019 to the first half of 2020, the effect of long -term exposure and complex exposure with other components was not included in this study.

Therefore, in order to affect the long -term or complex exposure, the disclosure of the ingredients included in the tobacco must be preceded, so it is necessary to revise the relevant laws and regulations such as the Tobacco Business Act and continuous monitoring in the future.

Meanwhile, the research is not analyzed for the harmfulness of the liquid electronic cigarette itself for the purpose of confirming the possibility of containing domestic products and the possibility of harmfulness of suspected suspected abandoned injuries, such as cases in the United States in 2019.

Therefore, it is necessary to note that this result does not mean that the liquid -type e -cigarette itself is not harmful or safe.

In particular, as of September, the United States maintains a recommendation to prohibit the use of liquid electronic cigarettes, especially Liquid -type electronic cigarettes containing THC and vitamin E acetate, and continuing to recommend that youth, pregnant women and non -smokers do not use e -cigarettes.It is introducing measures that prohibit the sale of liquid -type electronic cigarettes that are prohibited.

In addition, according to the WHO, the basis for the reduction and smoking effect of electronic cigarettes compared to other tobacco products is insufficient, and the Cigarette Regulation Basic Convention has also recommended the introduction of restrictions such as manufacturing and selling e -cigarettes.

The government will continue to provide related information to the people.

Therefore, the government will continue to monitor (monitor) of severe abandonment, death cases, and relevant regulatory policies in preparation for similar risk cases.

At the same time, the National Technical Standards and others conducted measures such as suspension and criminal accuracy of 55 stores caught among the 1791 stores last year, focusing on unauthorized renovation and illegal battery distribution sales.

By July this year, the company strengthened monitoring by receiving illegal battery sales reports at all times and conducting on -site surveys.

The government will continue to promote to prevent illegal battery distribution through online channels such as YouTube and SNS, which are mainly used by users of e -cigarettes.

In addition, the Ministry of Environment has investigated 120 high concentrations of nicotine products suspected of illegal income from November 2019 to August 2020, and discovered 18 violations, including 120 high -level nicotine products suspected of illegal imports, and failing to report imports.It has strengthened nicotine import customs clearance management.

The Korea Customs Service has also strengthened the investigation and detection of 'leaf extraction nicotine' illegally imported as 'stem nicotine' for avoiding the application of domestic tobacco regulations and tax evasion.It will strengthen the crackdown on imports.

The Ministry of Health and Welfare produced liquid -type e -cigarette hazard -related leaflets and SNS contents, and provided liquid -type e -cigarette education for teachers and teachers and teachers of early childhood education and childcare institutions.

In addition, the company received and caught the case of violating sales and advertising regulations through the 'Cigarette Sales and Promotion Report Center' and 'Internet Cigarette Sales and Advertising Monitoring'.The correction is completed.

The Ministry of Gender Equality and Family has focused on monitoring and cracking down on sales activities for liquid -type e -cigarettes with joint inspections and crackdowns on the city, county, district, and jurisdictions.The inspection activities will be continued.

Park Aung -hoo, Minister of Welfare, said, “We will continue to monitor and supervise illegal activities such as illegal batteries, illegal imports of nicotine, tobacco sales and advertising for liquid e -cigarette safety management, and to strengthen education and promotion.”.

“This is the analysis of the liquid -type electronic tobacco harmful component analysis that the possibility of human harmfulness in the United States and Europe has been used to use a forbidden substance material, and international trends in which the regulations on influential substances are introduced in various countries abroad.Considering, we will actively promote legislation to prohibit the addition of influential substances. ”
