The Ministry of Unification, the Ministry of Environment, and the National Institute of Ecology will conduct ecological surveys on our local wetlands for 10 months from November 2.

The ecological survey is conducted at the National Ecology Center, which is a subsidiary of the Ministry of Environment.

The two Koreas conducted a joint water survey on joint use of the Han River Estuary in 65 years after the signing of the Armistice Agreement in accordance with the 9.19 Military Sector Agreement in 2018.(35th) 10 experts from North and South Waterways participate in the waterway survey of 660km section

Since then, the survey will be conducted in order to collect basic data in preparation for further investigation of inter -Korean joints in consideration of the need for a more comprehensive and in -depth investigation of the ecology and environment of the Han River Estuary.

The Han River Estuary is an open earth where seawater is naturally introduced, and has the value of the world-class river-marine ecosystem (ECO-BELT), which is preserved for a long time without human interference.However, it is geographically located in the border zone, making it difficult to grasp the details of the details.

According to the survey and research results in the past, it is found that there is a spoonbird, which is an endangered wildlife, Suwon tree frog, endangered wildlife second -class Gary, little dragonfly, yellow jersey, moxibustion, and waterborne.there is.

In this survey, the Han River Estuary will investigate the distribution of wildlife and the geographical characteristics of plants, including the changes in the four seasons of the four seasons of our local wetland and its hinterland.

This survey is conducted on eight classification groups (algae, mammals, amphibian reptiles, vegetation, plant phase, land insects, and large -scale animals, fish).In addition, while using the location tracker, etc., it identifies the distribution status and characteristics of the wildlife (algae, mammal, etc.) that live in the Han River Estuary, while investigating the geographical characteristics of the plants through the sequence analysis of the plant genes.In addition, the genetic characteristics of plants that live in common in the north -south region will be secured, and the basic data for joint research between the two Koreas will be secured.
