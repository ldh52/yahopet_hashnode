초록

This study aims to develop a multi-functional cage for dogs as a house to reduce their anxiety when they go out using cages.

This study investigates the types and characteristics of cages and cage preference by surveying men and women in their 20s who use them. The cage product reviews are also analyzed.

The research results are as follows:

First, domestic dog cages are classified into crate, shoulder, cross (sling bag), backpack, carrier, and stroller types.

The crate type is easy to clean and can be used as a house, but it is bulky and therefore inconvenient to carry when using public transportation.

The shoulder type is a fabric material with good air permeability but has the disadvantage of being easily soiled. It can be used as a house and is light weight, making it convenient when using public transportation.

Second, as a result of consumer research, respondents prefer the shoulder-type fabric over the crate-type plastic material.

Third, from the shoulder-type product review, the shape stability, companion dogs' psychological safety, the wearability of companions, and management convenience are derived.

Fourth, based on the survey results, a multi-functional cage is developed taking into account the companion dog, companion person, and functional factors.
