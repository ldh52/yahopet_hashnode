In 2019, the literature 'Animal and Happy', which was organized by Konkuk University, was held.It is a series of lectures, which are companions that both people and animals could think of a happy coexistence.-Addivier Note-

On September 17 (Tuesday), a lecture on literature was held in Konkuk University.In the lecture, Ko Kyung -sun was conducted for two hours under the theme of 'Reading Animal and Etiquity from the Eye of Philosophers to Autonomous Life'.

The lectures were divided into part 1 and 2, and the first part was 'Animal as a human -centered worldview -an animal as an instrument being', and the second part was about the expansion of the masked -centered worldview -a leap to autonomous life.

Values ​​and philosophy ... Through the lecture, I learned the philosophy of animals that did not teach at school.The philosophers in the first part were Aristotle, Thomas Aquinas, Descartes, and Kant, and in the second part, Charles Darwin, Bentham, and Peter Singer.

We have been learning human -centered worldview so far, and therefore we have not had time to think about the rights of animals.One example can be found in Descartes philosophy, which emphasized reason.

Descartes said, 'I think.Therefore, I exist! '

Descartes, who learned at school, said, 'I think.Therefore, I was a philosopher who left a famous word, 'I exist, and the founder of modern philosophy that opened the way of rationalism that emphasizes reason.'

In the lecture, I could see how Descartes philosophy was applied to animals.

Descartes' philosophy, which thinks that animals are a soul -free machine, have influenced human cruelty to animals, such as providing animal abuse, and indulgence of guilt from using animals and abuse.Do it.

In the first part of the human -centered worldview, Aristotle is 'Animal exists for humans' ▲ Thomas Aquinas is determined to be used by humans by the providence of God.Animal was a tool for humans, such as 'Animal is a tool for human morality'.

In the expansion of the second part of the world's centralist worldview, Charles Darwin said, 'The ancestors of humans and animals are the same' ▲ Bentham 'Bentam is a kind of pleasure and pain'.The back is recognized as 'a leap into autonomous life'.

Ko Kyung -sun is teaching 'reading animal with the philosopher's eyes'

Thinking that humans are superior to animals, thinking of human and animal as a vertical relationship, and thinking of animals as soul -free machines ... Is we not lived naturally with these ideas for too long?

Peter Singer says that discrimination against animals is the last type of discrimination.Considering racial discrimination and gender discrimination, I sympathize with it."In a word, it is a matter of whether it is just to seal the right to seal the right just because it belongs to the species of 'Homo Sapiens' (Peter Singer, the reason why animals and humans must coexist).".

Animals that can't speak ... The values ​​and philosophy of our humans who see them right away!

This era demands new values ​​and philosophy that are different from the past.The inconvenience of pets, organic animals, wild animals, farm animals, and exhibition animals is increasing in the past as a human -centered worldview.Koh Kyung -sun explained that the values ​​and philosophy of animals were ongoing, and the title of Part 2 was set as 'leap into autonomous life' rather than 'autonomous life'.

In the eighth time of his companion literature, 'Read Animal with the Eye of the Philosopher' ... Ko Kyung -sun introduces the writings of Kan Kajes and Milan Kundera's writings.

Cite the contents of 'lightness of unbearable existence' and ask about the relationship with animals.

"Because of the concern that you might have to give up something or to go to the extreme, we often feel overwhelming in reconsideration of the relationship between humans and animals."For those that make us the human most human>

The true good will of human beings can only be pure and freely for those who have no power.The true moral experiment of mankind, the most fundamental experiment (which is in a very profound level and get out of our eyes) is in the relationship of the subject that has given us the whole destiny.Animals.This is a fundamental failure of humans in this part, and this failure is so fundamental that all other failures come from this ... Milan Kundera
