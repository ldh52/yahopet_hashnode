BASF NEW Business, a 100% subsidiary of global chemical company BASF, recently, G-Philos, a leading company in the field of P2G (Power to Gas, and transforming renewable energy into hydrogen)It has signed a memorandum of understanding to expand the global P2G market.Based on this, BASF and Jifilos will co -cooperate to expand hydrogen production using renewable energy.

Through this cooperation, Jifilos will be able to provide a power conversion device (PCS) for NAS (sodium-sulfur) battery that is applied to all models from 200 kW to 800 kW from BASF.By the end of 2022, BASF will supply 19.2 MWH NAS batteries to Korea by the end of 2022, cooperate with domestic and foreign P2G projects, and actively support Jifilos in the development of NAS battery power conversion devices in the future.

With the power generation of Korea, Jifilos is the first to operate a renewable energy -linked P2G system that produces hydrogen by utilizing the unused power of Sangmyeong Wind Power Complex (21MW) in Hallim -eup, Jeju -si.BASF was used as an electrical buffer between renewable energy with irregular output characteristics and a fuss -free device [1] by applying a high -efficiency power conversion device to the 200kW NAS battery supplied by BASF to enable stable operation of the system.

BASF New Business supplies NGK's high -energy density NAS battery around the world.The NAS battery, which can be discharged for 4 to 8 hours, is suitable for applications such as stabilization of power produced from renewable energy and application of power grid.

Park Ga -woo, CEO of Ji Pilos, said, “It is important to secure the reliability of system operation safety and long -term driving by applying the NAS battery as an electrical buffer to produce hydrogen stably while accepting the volatility of renewable energy.”We expect the battery to play an important role, and based on this, we plan to expand our various demonstrations of our company and sell out the green hydrogen commercialization. ”

"The green hydrogen production market is a promising and new field that can utilize NAS batteries," said Dr. Frank Prechtl, director of energy business director of BASF New Business.Throughout, we have a strong and competent partnership with great business potential. ”

Meanwhile, with the Korean government's announcement of the “Korean New Deal Policy”, new renewable energy production technology without carbon dioxide emissions is becoming important, and the technology to convert renewable energy power into gas as a linked technology has been in the spotlight.Like Europe, which has recently announced the EU hydrogen strategy, the green hydrogen production policy, which is linked to the supply of renewable energy in Korea, is expected to expand further in the future, and P2G technology is more important as a technical element to realize it.
