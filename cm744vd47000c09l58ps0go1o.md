In this conference, dogs' aggression, dog yoga, music effect, HAI research status, and animal mediation education were presented.It is often said that animal mediated treatment is helpful to humans, but it is not specific to how it helps.In that sense, the conference was an event that gave a clear answer to how animal mediation helps us.

At first, each presentation seemed to have no connection with each other at first, but after the whole, the big picture of animal mediation seemed to be drawn in my head.

It's not 'help!', It's helpful in this way, and the data that can prove it is here! 'The representative of the dog yoga association said, "I think it was an animal mediated therapy now," and now, through scientific data, "That's the effect of animal mediation treatment."I'm giving.

Based on scientific data, I hope that the field of animal mediation therapy will develop a lot in the future.The back will be the main field.
