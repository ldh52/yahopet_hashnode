When I greet the representative of Dongbuk Books, I see a cat lying in the chair next to me.When I asked, it is called 'floating'.Dungi is a long cat cared for in the dog beauty salon next to him.

Representative Shim Sun -hwa responds to the opportunity to do a pet bookstore bookstore.

"I was working in the IT industry as a web designer, and I thought someday I wanted to have a new work and my store, and I had a dog's 14 -year -old Shishu soothing.

It is said that Dongbuks, which was opened for soothe, is not able to cross the rainbow bridge now.However, there is a member next to Sim, and there are many guests who love pets.Even in this evening, there is a meeting to share refreshments with local residents from 7:00.

The pet culture of Uijeongbu seems to be developing here, as there is a hangout of companions, a companion book of companions, such as companion Books.
