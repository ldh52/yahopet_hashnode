Mofplin may be robot hamster, guinea pigs, baby rabbits, or other things, but it's not cute.

The Moplin, which began as part of the Kickstarter campaign of the Vanguard Industries released earlier this week, tries to follow the stages of other robotets such as Sony's Ibo or Qoobo.However, instead of simply no body shape attached to a fluffy floor such as QOOBO, Moflin uses AI to have “emotional ability” that uses AI to more accurately imitate the actual pet, so it expresses emotions and potentially as a treatment assistance.Can be used.

To this end, VANGUARD Industries said that the emotions of Mofelin have created their own emotional AI technology that allows them to respond and evolve over time based on contact with humans.Individual Moplin can have a unique personality depending on his experience and can learn how to respond differently according to the owner's behavior.In this way, Vanguard Industries said that Moflin can imitate the living animals more realistically.

It's too early to say how Moflin will work in the real world, but after watching a few photos and videos.Mofplin is inevitably lovely.The robot doesn't have a mouth, but you have no choice but to shut up between the small eyes and the squeaky and the way of shaking.I want to hug and protect my life.

Inside the fluffy shell, Mofpline has a simple body with a main joint for bending and rotating the head, and a variety of sensors (touch, microphone, accelerator, gyro scope, etc.), and Bluetooth 4.2, a rechargeable battery.It is also paired with the smartphone app for iOS or Android.VANGUARD Industries designed a small infant bed for Mofelin, which can be used as a wireless charger, so that it can be fueled and safe in small nests.

Mofpline even has a built -in sound engine that can produce an infinite number of noise patterns to better convey the mood even when Moflin is in a "sleep" state.And in the future, Vanguard Industries hopes to update Mofplin with new software to extend its lifespan and improve its functionality.After all, you won't just throw it away just because your pets are old.

The biggest disadvantage of Moplin is the price, except for the initial delivery date scheduled for March 2021.Currently, Kickstarter's Super Early Bird patrons costs 37,800 yen (about $ 360), which is more expensive than real cats and rabbits.

If Sony Aibo is more than $ 2,000, Moflin is a low price in some ways.And more importantly, Vanguard Industries is quickly approaching the funding target for Kickstarter, and the promise has already exceeded $ 13,000 out of the company's $ 19,000 goal.Of course, it is important to remember that, like all Kickstarter campaigns, sponsors may not see their return on investment.
