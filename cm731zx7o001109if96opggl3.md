Osan Early Bird Program Pet Care, which consists of high school 1st and 2nd grade.As the Early Birds program, the students experienced their career through class.The class that started with the vague curiosity of pets helps to explore career through field trips with theory.

We think that a program like 'Early Birds', which explores dreams and explores careers early in the school, has spent school days.

When I took 60 classes in each class…Wasn't it even 7080 when the teacher was also difficult to show interest to each student?Since only school grades were the best in more than 60 friends, where was the time to seriously talk to the same classmates about their dreams?

The Early Birds Program, which is being implemented in Osan City, is a program that gives students a chance to experience their dreams of vaguely.Thinking as one of the people who did not experience early birds…'Yes, it's a program that doesn't regret it, and I envy you.’.Anyone who has become a parent will envy the same.

Today, pet care and students were introduced to dog training, animal breeding (special animals), dog beauty, and animal mediated treatment at the Seoul National Arts School.The students may have found their own appearance in the form of seniors.‘百 不 不 不 如 一 見’ ’’ ’’ ’’ ’’.I am writing in anticipation of becoming a nutrient that is necessary to achieve my dreams in the future.
