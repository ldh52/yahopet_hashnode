Protatetec (CEO Lim Kuk -jin), a company specializing in in vitro diagnostic medical devices, announced on the 17th that it has obtained the new technology (Net) certification of livestock and water as a 'dog allergic 2 -line diagnosis method'.It is a new technology that diagnoses allergies of dogs in vitro to apply their own patented technology.'Anitia Canine IgE', an allergic diagnostic kit for dogs with new technologies, is the only licensed product in Korea and started selling in earnest from the beginning of this year.The test was inconvenient because it was directly exposed to observe the skin irritation response, and the diagnostic method of existing overseas products using the blood was not suitable for small pets because of high blood consumption.Prottehmtech's 'Anitia Canine IgE' can be tested with only 1/10 blood samples compared to existing products, reducing the burden on the blood of small dogs.By adding a parallel line technology, a patented technology, the test efficiency can be increased, and 66 species of da -dilipido allergies such as meat, fish, grains, fruits, vegetables, pollen, and fungus can be examined at once."So far, we have not been able to do animal allergies in Korea, so it takes about 7 to 10 days to send blood from the animal hospital and get the results, and the cost of the test was about 400,000 won."It is possible to inspect at a domestic veterinary hospital as a company, so that the results can be received in a short time at a lower cost than before.As a result, dogs and guardians who suffer from allergies can efficiently respond to dog allergic diseases based on economic costs and fast test results.In recognition of its efficiency, it is currently ranked No. 1 in the market share in the domestic allergic multi -diagnosis market and is focusing on entering the overseas market.
