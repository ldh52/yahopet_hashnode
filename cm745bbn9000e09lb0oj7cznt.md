How do you start your business?

Recently, young people who often do business and meet people who want to organize their business.On the other hand, we meet with investors and individuals who want to invest in ventures.I have been operating the company since 2003, and in 2013, I have also received the President's Award for $ 5 million.

Then, due to the deployment of the Sadd, it was closed in February 2018, and bankruptcy and immunity trials were available on June 21, 2019.It was a trial for nearly two years since the rehabilitation trial, which began in August 2017, but it was not a time to get help from anyone.Even the lawyers did not even talk about the legal stage that will proceed.No one could be responsible.It was only time to take care of everything alone and to overcome it alone.Fortunately, it is finished well now and is walking on the way again.

On June 21, 2019, he was immersed in and made various attempts, and he made a comprehensive nourishment for pets.Starting with the final immunity on June 21, with the help of the surrounding area, we created a corporation called <PIL Co., Ltd.) with 10 million capital in December.PLC, abbreviation.The company established the company to create a proper brand in the Korean pet industry.

The company established a corporation with a capital of 10 million won and received 50 million won from the Private Investment Association in late December.And now, the company is in the process of matching 100 million won from Korea's Angel Investment.In April 2020, the 2020 <Re -Challenge Success Package Project Project is a 50 million won additional investment attraction, the second government's matching fund, and the best award in the Innovative Failure Case Competition held by the Entrepreneurship Agency at the end of 2019I am preparing for>.

According to the current plan, I will create a corporation with a total of 360 million won with a capital of 10 million won by June 2020.It is just one year after the immunity decision in June 2019.After running the company for 16 years before bankruptcy, he has not owned more than 50 million won in a bank account, but he is in progress to recover more than 300 million won in his bank account while recovering again after bankruptcy.

In June 2003, he quit his work and started his business without knowing what it meant.To do a business, I needed an organization, a fund, and a time, but it was a business that started with motivation without anything.I thought it would be vaguely.But the result was different.Honestly, I would not have started business if I went back to that time.

I often meet people who have started their business around.And they ask me for advice.How to build a business and how to operate it.It is eager for their point of view.So, I want to answer him.In particular, I would like to talk about my experience to <Youth Startup> or <Startup>.

Those who know the way and walk without knowing the way are different from time, process and results.When you drive on the street, the driving veterans are at the forefront, even after being at the back.Because I know the way and know the trend of the car.I know how to hit and go out.The company should also.You need to know the flow.There must be an appropriate plan for Organization, Time, and Funds.

What kind of organization will be taken from the beginning of the business, what kind of person to build a company, what is the company's mid- to long -term goal, what is the means of achieving that goal, how to make money, and investing?If you want to make it only with national capital, or if you want to invest, you must start the business after preparing a comprehensive operation plan for who will receive.

By the way, I usually make a company first and think about it.The order is wrong.It is not the first to create a company, but to decide what to do and start the business.To set up a company, you must start preparing at least a year ago.

Often go to Pet Exhibition.The majority are young entrepreneurs.Since the pet side is smaller than other business areas and the barrier to entry is low, I see startups and youth start -up representatives who start business with one ideas.It is positive.But I want to ask them.How big and what are you preparing to complete?Do you run a basic concept for at least 5m (man, machine, material, manage, money)?

Only those who have been prepared can succeed properly.
