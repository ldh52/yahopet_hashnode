Serionix developed air filters using their NASA-award winning Colorfil technology, which is now available direct-to-consumers for eliminating odors and chemicals in homes.

Serionix는 NASA 수상 경력에 빛나는 Colorfil 기술을 사용하여 공기필터를 개발했다. 이 기술은 이제 가정에서 냄새와 화학물질을 제거하기 위해 소비자에게 직접 제공된다.

As part of their mission, Serionix has collected $1 from every Colorfil filter purchased and, on Tuesday, March 30, Serionix presented a check to the Champaign County Humane Society in the amount of $20,000. The donation goes to help animals in need of adoption--including feeding, sheltering, and providing them with necessary medical attention.

구매한 모든 Colorfil 필터에서 1달러를 모았으며 3월 30일 화요일에 Serionix는 Champaign County Humane Society에 2만 달러의 수표를 제출했다. 기부금은 입양이 필요한 동물에게 먹이를 주고, 보호하고, 필요한 의료 조치를 제공하는 것을 포함하여 지원된다.

"As a company we are all about creating clean, safe, and welcoming living spaces for pets and their humans," said James Langer, President of Serionix. "This partnership has provided a great opportunity for us to take that commitment to another level by giving back and providing for pets in need."

"We are so grateful for Serionix's support of CCHS," said Mary Tiefenbrunn, Executive Director of the Champaign County Humane Society. "It has been a tough year and they stuck with us. It means the world to us and to the pets in our care to have a local partner so deeply invested in supporting our mission."

With plans to expand operations and national marketing reach throughout 2021 and beyond, Serionix expects their impact to multiply many times over. Per Dr. Langer, "We joke about 'Answering The Call of Doody' but in all truth it's a joy and privilege to be doing our part--and we are enthralled to see our impact grow!"
