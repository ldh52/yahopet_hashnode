초록

This study was conducted to identify the influence of purchase-related factors and psychological factors as well as demographic characteristics on the owner's conative loyalty when purchasing companion animal feed.

The results of the analysis revealed the following:

First, in groups constituted according to age and average monthly household income, the concern of owners regarding a healthy diet for their companion animals showed a difference between the groups according to gender, age, and education level.

The feed preference showed differences between groups in terms of gender and age.

The conative loyalty for purchasing feed for the companion animal showed differences between groups in terms of gender, age, and education level.

Second, in this study, the analysis of the loyalty of the owners to specific companion animal feed showed that the explanatory power of demographic characteristics was quite low, while it was considerably increased when the variables related to the purchasing tendency for feed were added in step 2.

Therefore, in explaining the purchasing behavior of pet food, it is believed that identifying the factors directly related to purchasing, in addition to the demographic characteristics which were presented as important factors in previous studies, is important in understanding the owner's loyalty to a particular feed.

These results are expected to provide consumer data on the purchasing behavior of related products to researchers who study consumer response to companion animal feed.

The results will also provide useful information for establishing effective marketing strategies related to product development and distribution, etc. to companies in this sector.
