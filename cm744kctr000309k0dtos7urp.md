- Along with Noblezen, Sungkyunkwan University, and Hallym University research team, a wide range of virus treatments that are directly killed regardless of type

Noblezen (CEO Kim Tae -hyun) revealed an innovative viral treatment material that can treat Corona 19 at the same time with Professor Lee Seok -chan of Sungkyunkwan University and Professor Kim Won -geun of Hallym University.It is a mini-Antibody with a unique characteristic of hydrolysis. Noblezen is a biopharmaceutical development company that develops a wide range of virus treatments.Recently, Dr. Seung -seo Hong, CEO of Celltrion Healthcare and Dr. Kim Yong -jik, who served as CEO of Celltrion Healthcare and Celltrion COO, joined to speed up technology.He won the Korea Bioprocessing Excellence Awards.The Korea Bio Processing Excellence Awards is given to excellent professional, institutions, and technology in the field of biosing processing and cell and gene therapy.

The 3D8 SCFV, which was released this time, was discovered during the research process to cope with the plant virus by Professor Lee Seok -chan of Sungkyunkwan University and the research team of Professor Kwon Myung -hee of Ajou University.The area is expanding by expanding the area to the virus. 3D8 SCFV is a single-chain variable fragment (SCFV), which is one-sixth of the general antibody size, but has the same antigen cognitive ability as the antibody and is not protein.Nucleic acid (DNA, RNA) is targeted.

The three main features of a wide range of viral therapy and 3D8 SCFVs are ① viral nucleic acid hydrolysis, ② cell membrane transmission capacity, ③ and lung epithelial cell transmission capacity.3D8 SCFV hydroles the nucleic acid (DNA, RNA) of the virus.It works regardless of the type of virus and the nucleotide sequence of the nucleic acid.The nucleic acid hydrolysis of the 3D8 SCFV is maintained, regardless of the genetic type, so it is possible to respond quickly to the variant virus, the therapeutic virus, and the new virus, which is the largest barrier to the development of the therapeutic agent.Currently, many treatments are solved using additives or supplements, while 3D8 SCFVs can be naturally penetrated into cells by combining with protein on the cell surface without a separate drug (DDS).Instead, the 3D8 SCFV, which has passed through the cell membrane, can reach the cells in the organization and does not enter the nucleus of the cell."It can be developed as a medicine for the route."

Twindemic concerns, corona 19, influenza simultaneously treated at the same time.I showed it.The swine corona virus (SARS-COV-2) inhibited the viral genetic replication more than 90% at 10 µm, and the viral production was also reduced by more than 10 times.In addition, the human corona virus (HCOV-OC43) and the Pigsal Soldier Virus (PEDV) also showed a wide range of treatment when processing 3D8 SCFV as shown in SARS-COV-2.The results of the relevant study were published in the bio -ache (bio -arc.org), a pre -published field of academic papers.I confirmed that there is a treatment effect.Related research results will soon be published in the international journal.

The new virus, variant virus, and therapeutic resistant virus can be immediately corresponded to the all-in-one apploach that overcomes the limitations of the antiviral agent.In the flu virus, norovirus, pig fever virus, caustic rabies virus, and pig genital respiratory syndrome virus, 3D8 SCFV's antivirus effect was confirmed.In addition, the 3D8 SCFV gene was introduced with transformed rats, chickens, and pigs, and the antiviral effects for various viruses were added to use these transformed animals.The 3D8 SCFV is new.It will be a game chamber that can quickly respond to the appearance of viruses, variant viruses, and therapeutic viruses.This is in progress, and the clinical trial will be effective and safety.

Noblezen Outline Co., Ltd. Noblezen has developed a wide range of virus therapy that can prevent and treat diseases caused by viral infections, regardless of the viral gene type.Noblezen is developing prevention and therapeutic agents targeting new corona virus infections (covid19) and influenza virus, which are causing problems with people and animals worldwide, and can respond to new viruses that are newly emerging.We are conducting research for development.
