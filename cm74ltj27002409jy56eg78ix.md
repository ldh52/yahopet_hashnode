Gyeonggi -do announced on the 14th that it will promote the 'Pet Animal Insurance Support Project' for residents who participated in the pet registration system with Namyangju, Gwacheon, and Seongnam -si.

The Pet Animal Insurance Support Project is the first project to be implemented this year to activate pet registration systems to prevent organic animals, as well as to minimize conflicts caused by pets such as dog bites.

In addition to hospitalization, surgery, and treatment expenses for dogs suffered in an accident, they are also supported by pet insurance to guarantee liability for damages to others' physical, property, and pets due to dogs.

Among the residents of Namyangju, Gwacheon, and Seongnam, who have signed an agreement to implement this year, citizens who have fulfilled their duty to register their pets (dog dogs) as a built -in chip are automatically signed up without any separate procedures.

Among them, in the case of Namyangju and Seongnam -si, the cost of injury is 2 million won per year, and the liability for compensation is guaranteed within 5 million won per year.

The insurance period will be applied to Namyangju City from August 1 this year to July 31, next year, Gwacheon City, from September 8, next year, and Seongnam City from November 20 to November 19 next year..

However, if you receive a new built -in registration during this period, the one -year period is applied from the date of registration approval.In addition, the reason for the insurance payment occurred during this period is guaranteed even if the claim is made after the insurance period.

There are no restrictions on the age, troops, and breeds of dogs, but the compensation ratio, payment amount, and deduction amount may be different for each city and insurers.

The province expects to stabilize the pet registration system and reduce the development of organic animals, which will contribute to reducing social costs.

In addition, by guaranteeing a part of the medical expenses of dogs in injury, it is expected to reduce the burden of medical expenses for veterinary hospitals and to contribute to creating a safe society for both dogs and people through rapid treatment support for victims of dog bites.

Seo Kyung -hwa, head of the Animal Protection Policy Team, said, “It is a project designed to establish a responsible pet care culture through animal registration.”I hope you can get a life. ”

In case of insurance premiums, you can attach proof of documents and claim an insurance company contracted with the city by fax or e -mail.Related documents can be found in the Gyeonggi-do website (www.gg.go.kr) information-Animal Protection Board-Animal Protection Room.
