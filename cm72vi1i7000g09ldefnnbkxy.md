The Australian Macadamia Association has published a survey on the perception and consumption trend of generation Z's food.It was shown to have.This generation Z has been found to have high expectations in food and something extraordinary.The more you, the more positive it is.With the ambiguity of traditional meals and various snacks, generation Z prefers new food combinations that have not been seen before.It also actively accepts a unique perspective on food trends around the world and traditional food.

'Unusual' food is not a survival of generation Z, but pleasure, the brand of ingredients and the country of origin carefully checked

In China, young gourmets are looking for the latest products, ingredients and restaurants and erasing their own lists one by one, and in recent studies, it is the food that makes them feel like a mood.Appeared.Because of this expectation, the Z generation is looking for brands and products that can be proud of being a decent choice, and we are actively looking forward to more strict management and transparency in food and origin.

In the vegan craze, social and ethically desirable dietary -oriented Western market, aimed at 'Greater Good', a movement that removes meat and dairy products, and various forms such as vegetable -oriented meat consumption, zero waist and eco -friendly packagingSustainability of the sustainability is receiving steady attention.65%of the US Z generation says they want a vegetarian -oriented diet, and 44%recognize that vegetarian is better than smoking.In Asia, ethical food consumption is becoming active as the perception of food safety and quality increases.According to the Korea Vegetarian Union, vegetarianism has tripled about 10 years.

Both the body and mind are healthy, and the borders of consumption are transcending the border, and the Z generation rejects the myth that 'healthy' food is monotonous and boring.Generation Z consumers are ready to pay premiums for good healthy foods.In addition, generations Z are pursuing mental well -being as well as physical health through the intake of healthy protein, fat and antioxidants.

Thanks to the characteristics that can be used for various purposes of Macadamia, which is equipped with the main values ​​of the Z generation food selection, Macadamia is considered to be a very close ingredient in the pursuit of the Z generation.Macadamia has exquisitely balanced health, convenience, and luxuriousness that young consumers consider, as well as 'different' and sustainability.Consumers are looking forward to more vegetable products, and as reflecting this demand, the vegetable product industry in the Asia -Pacific is growing faster than any other region.In 2018, the global vegetable protein market was estimated to be $ 165.5 billion, and it is expected to grow more than doubled by 2025, reaching a total of $ 405.3 billion.

Catch the Z generation!How can the food brand will be able to capture the Z generation, which aims for the most conscious consumption among the consumers that the food brand has been in the way.Jim Richards, CEO of vegetable milk brand Milkadamia, said, “The younger generation who aims for eco -friendly wants to be a solution, not food and food.” Richard said, “Innovation is importantSometimes innovation is a means for the goal, not the final goal, ”he said.Innovation is just necessary for this, ”Milcamia has 10 milk and creamers.Last year, vegetable butter made of macadamia oil was added to the lineup.Milcamia brands and products are suitable for satisfying the desirable food demand for generation Z. Richard said, “Nowadays, consumers are aiming for wellness but looking at wellness.In the past, if the nutrition is limited to good nutrition, it is now more meaningful in the younger generation.Consumers want to be healthy, lively and healthy.At the same time, they also recognize that they cannot be healthy if they are not healthy, ”Richard said.I emphasize. ”This is because consumers comprehensively consider and expect more diverse elements than before when they choose the product. “Consumers are more positive than negative.In the past, if there were some ingredients that should not enter food, there are more discourses about the ingredients to enter these days.Future consumers want to accept food in a positive way, so many are moving to vegetarian -oriented meals. ”I have been working for a long time for the taste of.Richard said, “Our product tastes good, but it uses raw macadamia, not fried macadamia,” he said..

The motivation for vegetarian movement in the West and other Asian regions is somewhat different, but the sound food trend is a phenomenon among the Z -generation consumers in the Asian and Western markets.However, there are some differences in the maturity of the market in the consumption of vegetarian meals and especially in the consumption of Macadamia Milk.The Asian market is not yet reached, but Richard believes that it is ripe to enter the Asian market, especially in Korea, China and Japan.It is not the case to enjoy the product, and Macadamia products such as our products are such premium products.Young Chinese consumers buy premium products, so I think that products such as Milcamia will come to these consumers with a big attraction. ”Richard is currently developing a new Macadamia drink product and health that is a generation of generation Z,It will be released in the form of an RTD product that is perfect for taste, eco -friendliness and convenience. Richard said, "The world is really fast."
