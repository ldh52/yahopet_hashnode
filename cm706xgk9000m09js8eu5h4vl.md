April 22nd is Earth Day, our yearly reminder to reflect upon how our actions impact the planet. However, as pet parents, we need to also think about how we can reduce our pet's carbon pawprint. Dr. Ruth MacPete, aka Dr. Ruth "The Pet Vet", shares some simple ways we can ensure our pets are living greener and cleaner.

#### Waste Management

If you have a cat, consider switching from a clay-based litter to a biodegradable litter, such as ökocat. ökocat is a sustainably sourced cat litter made from rescued wood and packaged in a fully recyclable paper bag. In addition, it contains no synthetic chemicals, no toxic dyes, and no added artificial fragrances. By switching to a biodegradable litter, you can cut down on the estimated 2 million tons of clay litter that end up in landfills every year.

#### Don't Pollute

Always pick up after your pet. Besides being inconsiderate, leaving your pet's waste behind can pollute water sources from runoff. Follow the backpacker's motto and pack out what you pack in and leave only footprints (or pawprints) behind.

#### Buy Green

Purchase pet beds, furniture and toys made from recycled or sustainable materials such as wool or hemp. Environmentally friendly hemp can be used to make almost everything, like leashes, collars, beds and toys. Nowadays it is easy to find recycled pet products at large pet retailers all across the country.

#### Buy in Bulk

Buying pet food and pet supplies in bulk not only saves money, it also conserves fuel and lowers emissions by saving you extra trips to the store and cuts down on packaging.

#### Pet Overpopulation

Make sure your pet isn't adding to the pet over-population problem by having your pets spayed or neutered. Shelters spend millions of dollars caring for homeless pets. Consider donating your old towels, blankets to a nearby shelter. This helps you declutter, helps the shelter cut costs, and gives a needy pet a nice blanket to sleep on. If you have the time, consider volunteering at a nearby shelter.

#### Adopt a Shelter Pet

Don't forget about your local animal shelter or pet rescue if you are thinking about getting a pet. There are lots of amazing animals that need a good home. While adopting one of these deserving pets may not lower emissions or save fuel, it can save a life.

By adopting these simple tips, you and your pet can live green and make the planet a better place.
