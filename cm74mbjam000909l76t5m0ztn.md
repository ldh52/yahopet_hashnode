On May 11 (Sat), 2019, a pet community app PetTalk (CEO Lee Do -il) was offline meeting at the Madle Stadium dog playground.The meeting was attended by petTalk members living in Seoul and Gyeonggi -do.

Madle Stadium located in Nowon -gu, Seoul, and only listen to the information that there is a soccer field inside, and visit public transportation.When I arrive, the main gate is so good that I can see that this is a Madle Stadium from afar.

Pass the main gate and walk towards the dog playground.Madle Stadium ... There is a soccer field as I thought, and a promenade is built around the soccer field.Although I passed around the Madle Stadium by car, I didn't know that the park would be built in it.The promenade is an Anseong Mad dance to walk with a dog.

I arrive at the dog playground and meet with PetTalk's representative, members, and welcoming me.And it is recommended to taste the refreshments and food that the members have prepared.

Looking back on the memories, this scenery seems to have met in a good countryside when I was young.There is no chance to talk with neighbors and talk happily.

Pets are mediated, people meet, talk, and share foods.The power that allows people to gather from the world's killings, that's the heart of people who love pets.

Pet community app, pet talk!

Through PetTalk, we met the gathering of people who were welcomed than green in May and green forests.

The smell of pet talk that smells like a human, and this friendship is delivered to more people, and Yajoppet cheers to become an online and offline space where pet love and the warmth of their neighbors are felt.
