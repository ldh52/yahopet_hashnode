- Those who come to me are so deep in this field.So I don't dare to promote

On the last day of the May 18th holiday, I will search Naver to meet Yangpyeong's companions.More than 30 places have been planned through search.There were more cafes and pensions than Hongcheon.

Among them, there was a person who had heard of the news through the usual blog, and I was curious about what he was.I talked with my teacher who welcomed me and talked about pets.

More than 10, he studied about animal behavior correction abroad, and was taught for dog trainers.

He says that he needs to understand each layer even in understanding pets, as in the fifth stage of Maslow's desire.Based on these layers, they are correcting their pet behavior, and the dogs they visit lead them to socialize in the crowd.

Cheongbong, who has vowed to interview who meets, but the hidden substitute is a polarization.“The person who comes to me is so deep in this field.”That's why you don't promote it.Listening to that, I could feel deeper respect as I had a conversation and talking.

The teacher also told me about reproduction, and I could learn a lot of things I didn't know and didn't know it.

"In the past, wild animals were reproduced. The same is true of the dogs of the wolf. So dogs are more friendly to reproductive, and reproduction is more nutritious."

And I remember this.

“Grain Free”, no grains.In the past, grains were made of grains, but nowadays grain free feeds are sold.

After all, dogs prove that carnivorous feeds fit their mouths rather than grains.

All of the teachers 'dogs are reproduced, and the dogs' teeth were all clean.I asked if I was good at brushing my teeth.This is all because it is reproductive.

It was amazing to see the effect of reproductive.

I had a deep conversation about pets for a long time.It was like a chimney to introduce the teacher to many people, but I was able to soothe my sadness because I had a more valuable story.From the afternoon to late night, we talked and ate, and we talked about the world as well as pets.

Yangpyeong's hidden pets!

On the last day of the holiday, I met a good person.The words you heard will be the power to reflect on the parts you haven't seen.Thank you so much.
