Neutralization surgery from long cat capture by cat moms, a series of TNR processes that radiated in place, and I observed the neutralization surgery in this series of process today.After that, the male is one day for one day, and for females for three days, and again in place.

Kim Jae -young, chairman of the Korean Cat's Society, gave his feelings on his Facebook.

Classical TNR medical service. I wondered what is the way to improve the happiness of the TNR and the happiness and the residents' complaints of TNR, which are currently ongoing in Korea.Write a few words about the difference between individual TNR and cluster TNR.In the individual TNR, TNR (capture -neutralization surgery -in -place radiation) for simple complaints when a long cat is received, but the cluster (group) TNR is a civil complaint.Regardless of the ward office, the ward office provides a medical service site, and the Catmam, which is well aware of the state of the local cats, is in charge of capturing and surgery, and veterinarians from all over the country are cat health check, basic treatment, neutralization surgery.Infectious diseases, vaccinations and repellent administration, the local cat cats stabilize the ecosystem and resolve the residents' complaints.If the clustering TNR progresses, it will be possible to proceed with predictable animal protection and welfare policies by identifying more clear long cats, not policy designs by long cat statistics, and installation and management of stable meals.

The first local cluster TNRâ€¦

The cluster TNR was carried out in the order of the local government re -employed the place, and after the Catmam captured, the medical volunteer group was neutralized and the Catmam was again radiated.It was a work that worked hard to do alone.This time, the cluster TNR conducted in Jungnang -gu is an opportunity, and it is activated elsewhere, and it is expected to become a cluster TNR that contributes to the stability of the ecosystem.
