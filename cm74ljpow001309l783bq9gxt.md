Koh Kyung -sun introduced a book called Petros and Rita Reynolds' Pet: Pet's death.

"I know that my souls of my animal friends are continuing to go on a new trip, and we know that our relationship does not end with death. Death is just a temporary hejim.There is no place to be there. "-Rita Reynolds' Petros: Pet's Death'-

When a pet dies, he says that he crosses the rainbow bridge.

[Wiki Tree] The expression 'rainbow bridge' was taken from the poetry of the author, made in the United States or the United Kingdom in the 1980s.In this poem, there is a rainbow bridge that connects heaven and the ground, and the animal loved by a person always has something to eat, warm, young, and healthy.These animals play peacefully and happily, but miss their owners who saved him.And finally, when the owner dies, he meets and crosses the rainbow bridge to heaven and never breaks up again.

In Rita Reynolds' book, 'I know that our relationship does not end with death. Death is just a temporary hejima,' is it not necessary for the companions to accept the pet's death as a temporary breakup?

From the standpoint of a person who has not been through the actual petos, the words that can only be understood rational, 'Petros' ... Ko Kyung -sun instructor is the attitude of sympathizing with the pain of Petros through lectures, a temporary pet's deathI wanted to talk about the attitude I looked at.
