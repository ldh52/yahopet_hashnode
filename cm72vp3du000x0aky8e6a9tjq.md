Three nice cranes in the winter, a welcome guest in winter, found Suncheon Bay Tidal Flat around 2:19 pm on the 23rd, five days later than last year.

In September, the Black Crane, which appeared with the Hope Agricultural Complex in Suncheon Bay in September, was shown in Suncheon Bay in a month.

The black crane was tired of long -distance flights, trimming feathers from the tidal flats next to the circular reeds, replenishing their health with animal food, and flying into the sky.

Suncheon City launches migratory birds such as the installation of reeds for blocking vehicles, the creation of a migratory shelter, and the food prey to provide a stable habitat for winter migratory birds, including black cranes and other winter migratory birds.

'Heavy Korea' and Black Crane paintings, which were engraved on the Black Crane Hope Agricultural Complex as landscape agricultural complex, will be left by the end of February next year, and will be offered in early March, when migratory birds are shortened.

An official of Suncheon Bay Management Center, Suncheon City, said, “Suncheon Bay is the world's most observed of endangered species among 200 major wetlands in Korea.”We ask for active cooperation in control. ”

Meanwhile, Suncheon City opened two poultry farms near Suncheon Bay to preemptively block high -pathogenic AI, while opening some of Mujin Bridge -Tooked Dynasty and Anpoong Wetlands, which were temporarily closed during the winter migratory birds for domestic explorers.It is strengthening the restoration of habitats such as habitat and blocking AI.
