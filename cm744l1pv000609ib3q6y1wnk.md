Lotte Mart said, "I admit that I did not care about the position of the dogs in the process of accompanied by the accompanying customer service," he said.In addition, we promise to clarify the guidelines for the Puppy Walker and the awareness in the field, and to actively respond to the emergency warrior sharing to prevent the same case. ‚ÄùThis was triggered by the staff blocking the access of the preliminary guide dog that visited Lotte Mart Jamsil on the 29th.

Despite the announcement of Lotte Mart's apology, public opinion is cold.Lotte Mart's official Instagram is posting articles asking for a responsible apology.

The guide dog refers to a particularly trained dog that becomes the eyes and ears of the disabled.Exit for hypermarkets is one of the necessary processes for guide dog training.If there is no legitimate reason in Article 40 of the Disabled Welfare Act, it cannot be rejected by volunteers for the disabled, the disabled, or the disabled auxiliary training.

Guide dogs are trained to stay with their guardians without responding to various stimuli.Overseas, they also train to watch musical performances.

This is what happened from Lotte Mart, saying, 'The employee lacked an understanding of the guide dog, and it happened because it was not good at knowing the current law.'

Although people's perception of guide dogs is improving, there is still a lack of understanding as a culture.If the disabled was banned from entering Lotte Mart, it would have been a bit of a thing from the people.However, I think that the refusal to enter the preliminary guide dog in education is not intentional but a lack of awareness.Nevertheless, as citizens say, it will be necessary not only for the apology of 'employees', but also for the sincere apology of the employee.

The Lotte Mart's refusal to enter the preliminary guide dog will be a turning point that everyone recognizes and sympathizes with the entrance of the preliminary guide dog.
