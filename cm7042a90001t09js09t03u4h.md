Smart toys are quickly becoming more than just a fad: they’re the future of play for pets.

These days, we have an abundance of smart devices at our disposal. From smart home devices to smart cars, our world is becoming more and more connected. And because of that, so is your pet.

What is a Smart Toy?

A smart device is any device that collects data from users and can connect to other devices to share that data. Other devices can include smart home devices, fitness trackers, and wearable devices such as activity monitors.

Smart toys for your pets are electronic devices that connect to your mobile device via Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or an app.

They may adapt their play patterns based on the time of day, your location, and your preferences. They may offer interactive games, educational activities, or rewards for good behavior.

These toys can be used for both active and sedentary pets that want to stay occupied. Active pets may want to run around, while sedentary pets may want to doze off.
