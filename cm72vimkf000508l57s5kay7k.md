Suseong -gu (former Kim Dae -kwon) held a opening ceremony of the Citizen's Garden Training Course at Daegu Agricultural Meister High School on the 16th.

In June, the Citizen's Garden Training Course gathered the opinions of various experts through the Sumi Creation Forum on the theme of “Green City”.Through this, the plan and curriculum have been finalized, and from September, the company has recruited citizens' gardeners who can be active in the region.

The training is 85 hours a total of 85 hours, and it is conducted by garden culture, philosophy, plants, sea, garden management, and practice.Citizen's gardeners plan to work in lecturers, consulting, and civic gardens after completing education.In addition, starting next year, we will participate in the construction of the garden in the city with the village gardeners, which are composed of about 10 to 20 people.

Dongdong Village Gardens will create an indoor veranda garden and living room garden in Suseong -gu, where apartment -centered residential culture is developed.Afterwards, the company plans to build a pocket garden in every street in the city to form a culture of walking naturally.

Kim Dae -kwon, the head of Suseong -gu, said, “It is important to create a community culture that coexists in nature and people.” “We will continue to operate and support systematic civic education for this culture.”
