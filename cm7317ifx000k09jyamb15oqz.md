Hong Yu -seung (Byung -hwan), chairman of Dog Korea, said, “Even those who are legally operating pet shops must sell pets with DNA in the future.It is our goal to make Korea. ”

"If you can welcome your dog as a new family with transparency and reliability of growth, the rejection of the sale will gradually disappear," he says.

In addition, "Dog Korea System will be issued a lineage certificate with a DNA inspection letter and a DNA number of DNA and Dogs when adopting. In addition, health medical certificate, pet insurance, and white paper are issued and GPS necklaces and governmentsThe animal registration card is also paid, as well as the elements needed to take care of the dog.

"The real name system is proved by the dog's lineage. The guardian can confirm the dog's and the dog's dog and the mother. You can easily check it online."

Dog Korea Co., Ltd. confidently speaks of the belief that we make a country without dogs based on many years of preparation.

A country without an organic dog

According to the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, a survey of 5,000 people, the 2019 National Awareness Survey on Animal Protection, 67.3%of the companions who participated in the animal registration.

Another thing to look at is SBS's report*.According to SBS, the number of lost and organic animals registered in the Animal Protection Management System from January 1, 2010 to June 30, 2020 is 94,098.

Dog Korea, who is trying to create a 'country without organic dogs', says that he will manage his dog through the 'DNA Real Name System' from the pre -sale stage.To this end, Dog Korea will create a 'organic country' through agreements with various domestic organizations and personnel such as the Korea Genetic Information Institute, the Korea Animal Hospital Association, the Korea Police Dog Training School, Wonkwang University, Chunghyeon Animal Hospital, and Chungcheong Ilbo.It explains the purpose of the company.

Dog Korea's pre -sale system will be able to bring about animal registration through the DNA real name and to prevent organic animals.In addition, if you can't raise it, don't throw it away, and bring it, and your guardian education system will complement the parts that the government is not running.I think this series of systems will contribute greatly to 'making Korea without organic dogs'.

Furthermore, the acquisition of Chinese patents related to Dog Korea's 'DNA Real Name System' is written, thinking that it will be a new milestone to inform our excellent system to China.
