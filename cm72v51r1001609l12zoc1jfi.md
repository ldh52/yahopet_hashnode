The Agriculture, Forestry and Livestock Quarantine Headquarters (Director Park Bong -kyun, hereinafter referred to as “Having Headquarters”) launched the construction of the Foot -and -mouth disease diagnostic BL3 (Biosafe Safety Level 3)* Laboratory on October 5th.

* BL3 (Bios safety grade 3): A research facility rating that handles a virus that has a high risk of individuals and causes serious diseases in humans and animals

This new laboratory is expected to be able to strengthen its role as a foot -and -mouth disease OIE standard laboratory by being dedicated to foot -and -mouth disease experiments.

Until now, a part of the foot -and -mouth disease vaccine production facility has been used for foot -and -mouth disease diagnosis, but if a dedicated experimental space is secured, it will be able to build an infrastructure as a foot -and -mouth disease OIE standard laboratory where cell culture, genetic analysis, and international conference can be held.

The laboratory in the quarantine headquarters, which aims to be completed in August 2022, has a total floor area of ​​2,962.97㎡.The design began in June 2019 and completed in April 2020 and began construction on October 5.

The new building, which is scheduled to spend KRW 170 billion, consists of 4 floors from the first basement to the 4th floor above the ground, which consists of an office, an international conference room, a cell culture room, a genetic analysis room, a laboratory, and a preliminary research laboratory.

When the facility is completed, it will be possible to conduct in -depth research for the development of foot -and -mouth disease viruses and diagnostic methods, and plans to open some spaces to private research institutes later.

Kim Jae -myung, manager of the Quarantine Division, said, “We have established an infrastructure base for international status through the construction of the newly built foot -and -mouth disease OIE standard laboratory, which continues to develop foot -and -mouth disease diagnosis technology and the status of the quarantine headquarters as a national research institute as a national research instituteI will increase. ”
