On July 11 (Sat), Gangcheon Elementary School in Chungju, which was closed, was renovated in a new form and appeared in front of the neighbors.

There are many schools in the country that the population decreases and is being closed.Gangcheon Elementary School, which had a large number of students, was also closed last year by reducing the number of students to 30 students.

Choi Young -nam, chairman of Dog Nolja Co., Ltd., who was the first alumni chairman of the school, was sorry for this, and thought, 'How can I use the closing school? "

If you have traveled on a bicycle road that is well developed by bicycles, you will have passed once.If you leave Seoul and head south, it is said that the day will be around Chungju.

When the day is over, you will find a place to be tied up one night, but in the past, there were not many places that were right nearby.Next to the road where the bicycle passes, Chairman Choi thought, 'Why don't you use a closed school to create a shelter?'It is said that I thought.

Choi's thoughts led to practice, and last Saturday, he finally had a fruit and celebrated with many people.
