Taconic Biosciences, a global leader who supplies animal model solutions for new drug development, announced that it will launch Expressmodel®: Random Integration Transgenic (RITG), a new service that can save the cost and time of animal model creation.In order to create animal models for new drug development, various genetic editing technologies are applied according to the common goals of creating a specific genetic profile.The technology applied to the creation of the Ritg model produces an initial litter, which may not have or express intended genetic properties.In general, each animal goes through the process of raising various generations to determine which of the desired results can be achieved.This process is long and expensive.Expressmodel®: Ritg can be a solution to reducing the burden on the industry that needs to reduce the timeline and cost for the development of new treatments.Expressmodel®: RITG is the first mountaineer, instead of breeding and characterizing individual ancient animals and cubsIt analyzes transformed genes and animal reproduction.This approach reduces various risks that follow the creation of the Ritg model.First, by identifying successful animals initially, inaccurate genetic profiles can prevent the waste of resources mobilized for animal reproduction.In addition, it is possible to secure the predictability of downstream activities because it secures the correct animal in the early process, which is high in that various projects must be in close harmony with other stakeholders and resources.In addition, the client can set the final cohort size and animal health standards as desired, and to preemptively secure a small number of animals, which can reduce the number of animals needed throughout the project."Expressmodel® portfolio is designed to promote the model creation process by using expertise and competence," said the science service team leader.Expertise related to sperm frozen, in vitro fertilization and transformed genetic analysis was combined.This eliminates the risk of gene editing technology.Customers can secure decisive data a few months ahead of the existing method, and this is rare in that it does not have to give up any one between time and quality. ”It is a model generation service provider and has more than 20 years of experience in the model creation field.We provide genetically disabling, gene mutations and alternative, gene transfer, RNAI (RNA interference) and gene editing through CRISPR/CAS9 technology, allowing each customer's project to use the correct form of tools.Taconic has a unique capacity to provide complete forms of solutions to customers through smooth service, from model design to breeding and population management.Such scientific services include purchases and creation, export, licensing, breeding, testing, and global distribution of genetically modified models.The details of the taconic model creation solution can be added by phone or e -mail.(Taconic BIOSCIANCES, INC.) Opponents Taconic Bioscience is a genetically modified rodent model and service provider that has been officially approved.Founded in 1952, the taconic purchases important research models for bio technology companies and institutions around the world, creating, breeding, adjusting, testing and distributing.Specialized in the integration of genetically modified rats and mouse models, and integrating model design and breeding services, takonic operates three service institutes and six breeding facilities in the United States and Europe.It also has a number of distribution rights in Asia and has a global delivery capacity to provide animal models everywhere in the world.
