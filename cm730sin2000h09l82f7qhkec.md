In the past, the pet food industry, which has been somewhat far from the word change, has been experiencing more changes than any other industry in recent years.This is the result of the mega trends such as the humanization of pet food, and since the unprecedented situation occurred earlier this year, the speed and diversity of these changes has been intensifying.

The biggest change in our lives is that as people stay at home, the number of pets and “petcocks” with pets is increasing.Naturally, the intimacy of companions and pets became more intimate.

Experts say the biggest side effects of the Corona situation are social anxiety.In that sense, pets are not just to be protected, but now they are now expanding to the relationship between pets and companions, such as comforting the anxiety of companions and helping to restore stability..

As such, the emotional sympathy between the pets and the companions and the increase in intimacy are increasing interest in pet supplies, and the North American pet supplies market is also booming this year.

This month, let's take a look at the changes taken by the Corona situation and the major trends that the world's pet food industry is paying attention to.1. The higher health of the pet's health is a very important factor not only for pets but also in human life.However, the health of pets is even greater for us, because of the fact that it is an animal that cannot be expressed as painful, and the emotional factors that come in significantly shorter than humans.

For companions, there is eagerness that the pets they raise will be as healthy as possible.According to a recent survey by Kerry, a US pet food raw material processing company, 75%of dogs, cats and companions who live with their pets say that pet food made with such a disease is helpful if their pets suffer from certain diseases.I did it.

Perhaps it may be natural, but the concept that past diseases should be treated mainly through medical behavior has prevailed, while now it is interesting to change the consciousness that the disease can be treated through the pet food that is consumed every day.

This is a change when pet food is started as a standard of food that people eat, and it is an extension of people trying to treat diseases and protect health through food.2. Fresh Pet Food's soft -lined pet food (pet food that is not processed or minimized) is one of the fastest growing pet food segments in North America.

In North America, Sunsik Pet Food, which is so popular that it is easy to find in small pet shops for many years, is no longer a strange concept for domestic consumers.BARF (biologically suitable reproductive pet food) is also known as a cold and frozen facility, so it is difficult to settle in the domestic offline market because of the hassle of having to have refrigerated and frozen facilities, but it is very active in the online market.The reason why food is in the spotlight is due to the premium of pet food.

LID using limited raw materials (thus less allergic), pet food made from low -temperature drying methods that minimize raw material processing, and water content to 5% or less, minimizing nutrient loss and long -term storagePrimaization, which has been developed into a pet food made with the freeze -drying method, is now moving to Sunsik Pet Food in earnest.

There is still a division of opinions among experts about whether the line is the best pet food.

Especially in the case of meat, there is a disadvantage that it is difficult to manage enough that the recall is occasionally occurring in North America, which is leading Sunsik Pet Food.Nevertheless, the desire of companions who want to pay better food to pets is expected to continue to grow the Sunsik Pet Food Market.3. Grainfry Pet Food and extended cardiocardiopathy (DCM) Issue of North American Pet Food's biggest topic is the correlation between Grain Free Pet Food and extended cardiomyopathy.

Experienced cardiomyopathy is a disease in which the ventricles are larger than the normal size, as can be seen from the word “scalability”.

The relationship between the disease and the grainfry pet food began to be highlighted, when the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) began to investigate the correlation between grainfry and scalable cardiomyopathy.

Although no connection is yet revealed between the two, the FDA's investigation has caused great anxiety among many companions who have paid grainfry pet food in North America.

The concept of grainfry began with the concept that the ancestors of pets, especially dogs, were a carnivorous wolf, and thus, for dogs.Grainfry Pet Food has been attracting great attention in the market in recent years, and is now popularized in the entire pet food market.Because of the belief in the grainfry concept, the FDA's investigation is approaching a greater shock to companions.4. The hot interest of North American companions on the transparency of transparency pet food for raw materials can be seen through the Clean Label Project introduced in the previous article.

This is the result of the mega trend of pet food humanization.It started.

In addition to interest in origin, it is interesting to see how the raw materials are made (for example, how to cultivate, grow crops or livestock in ethical ways) and the process of creating raw materials is widening the environment..

The world -class pet food brand Origen is marked on the back of the wrapping paper where the main raw materials are from the area.This effort is getting a good response by giving the feelings that companions can communicate with those who produce raw materials.Experts say the Corona has raised interest in the transparency and eco -friendliness of raw materials.According to the announcement of IRI, a market research firm, more than 22%of companions are interested in eco -friendly pet food, which suggests that the transparency and eco -friendliness of raw materials is very important in developing pet food in the future..5. Interest of PB products, PB Pet Foods, which are sold by raw materials and low -prices, have been distributed in North America for a long time.there is.

The current US economic situation, which is comparable to the Great Depression, has been serious since 1947, with GDP dropping 32.9% and the number of unemployed people exceeded 30 million.The economic downturn has increased the demand for low -cost pet food, which shows the results of the investigation of the US Package Facts.

According to a survey conducted in April and May in April and May, Packaged Facts can realize the popularity of PB products by saying that 47%of US companions buy more PB products than before.In a survey conducted earlier this year, 44%of respondents said that there is no quality difference when PB products compared with brand products, which shows that the popularity of PB products is not only because of the price.

Experts say that the longer the corona situation, the higher the popularity of PB products.The premium of pet food is accelerating and the demand for low -cost products is also increasing.At the end of the article, the Mega trends, such as the emergence of millennials and the humanization of pet food, have rapidly changed the pet industry.And these mega trends are correctly faced with various sub -trends caused by these mega trends, and the necessity of preemptive response and change is becoming more important than ever.

Any industry is always afraid and uncomfortable.But we should not forget that we can survive in the pet food industry, which is constantly evolving, and further grow.
