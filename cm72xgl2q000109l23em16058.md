Konkuk University General Graduate School of Veterinary Medicine Ph.D. Yoon Jung-hwan (Professor of Experimental Animal Medicine Major Professor Han Jin-soo) Recently, the World Allergic Association-The JSA/WAO JOING RESS 2020, a regular academic conference in the Japanese Allergic Society.(BEST SPEAKER AWARD) 'Award.In this competition, Dr. Yoon presented the theme of 'SMAD4-Mediated TGF-β Signaling Suppresses Th1 and Th17 Differentiation in the Pathogenesis of Psoriasis in the dermatology and mini symposium. 'Best Speaker'It was selected as a doctoral student who was selected as an effective immune cell, which is the effective immune cells, which are mainly effective in pathological development and treatment of psoriasis, one of intractable chronic inflammatory skin diseases.We studied the mechanism of molecular interaction between the inhibitory cytokine, the transformed growth factor beta (TGF-β) signal system and the inflammatory cytokine signaling system.In cells, TGF-β signal transmissions control certain genes through molecules called SMAD, of which SMAD4 molecules play a pivotal role in signaling.By direct and indirectly controlling the expression of major warrior factors of the cells, Th1 and Th17 cells, it controlled cell differentiation, and thus the mechanism of suppressing the outbreak of psoriasis was recognized worldwide.The research was conducted as a basic research project for the Korea Research Foundation's 'Initial Research Project', and was conducted in collaboration with Kyungpook National University Hospital Life Medicine Research Institute.
