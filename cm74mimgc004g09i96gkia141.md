Curator ... Recently, the general public also encounters this term, but it's actually a difficult term.The phrase easily explained about the curator says, "Collect, manage works at museums or museums, and plan exhibitions.

The word curator, originally used as an art term, is now widely used in various fields of society such as museums, fashion, food, and digital curators.You can sometimes meet curators in the pet field.

I met the curator that I heard only in words, and it is Baek Ah -young curator who is preparing for the 'Earth Conquest Super Cat Festa'.I met with Baek Ah -young curator and introduced the curator with the curator.

Below is a question that I shared with Baek Ah -young curator.

Q: Introduction of Curator A: I worked as an independent curator in charge of the gallery exhibition or exhibition.Along with the artists in their 30s and 40s, they conducted exhibitions focusing on contemporary art such as painting, installation, photographs, and media.

Q: How did you plan and prepare this event?

A: I loved the cat, so I was in charge of the exhibition of artist Kim Ha -yeon's work.It became a relationship, and Meow came to know Park Sang -wook in the newspaper, and I started naturally with Park's introduction.

Q: Introduction to Earth Conquest Super Cat Festa A: 4 years ago, Gungdi Pang Fang Market, which was the form of a market, became Cat Festa, followed by the K -Cat Fair.Supercat Festa is preparing to show a differentiation from the previous event as a latecomer.

Beyond the consumption of product, we have envisioned a fair to consume cat culture, and I hope those who visit through this fair will enjoy the culture and be happy.

We discover new companies for the event and are also involved in brands that are popular with deacons.

I have prepared a lot of events, but the event is prepared to be such an event, with the content that communicates with the deacons, and there is a story that goes and goes with the deacons through the content.
