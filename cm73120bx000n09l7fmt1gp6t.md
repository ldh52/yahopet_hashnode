On November 5, Daegu Seo -gu Naedang Social Security Council (Chairman Park Sang -seok) placed Poin Setia directly to the guidance of a horticultural therapist to relieve the depression of single -person households caused by Corona 19.

The event was prepared to take care of the plants (Poin Setia) for the cold winter when indoor life is increasing.

Chairman Park Sang -seok said, “I hope that it will be a little helpful for the difficult neighbors of single households who have longer indoor life with Corona 19 through small sharing.”
