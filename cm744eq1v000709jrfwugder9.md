It was the first time in December 2012 that I first learned animals and people, and it was also a time when I started to be interested in pets.

When I went to the animal and human homepage, it is said that animals and people were established in February 2012.When I first met animals and people online that I had been active for a year, I felt that it seemed different from other places.

In the winter of 2012, one day after five years of meeting animals and people online, I was able to meet animals and people offline offline.The meeting became a relationship, and the 'dog forest', which was opened in Chuncheon through Yahopet, also introduced.Eagle is a story from 2017 about animals and people.

September 2017

The first time I met animals and people offline was in September 2017, at the seminar held at Gangwon National University.The seminar was invited by the USDDN world champion Hiraiyachi to introduce the secrets of Frisbee and Hiraiyachi's know -how.

Hiraiyi and other Hirai families are famous not only in Japan but also in Japan.I was an extracurricular question about Frisbi, and I was able to see a new culture called Doksports through the seminar.

In April 2018, the Chuncheon seminar of animals and people became a ties and attended the second seminar.At this time, Hiraiyachi's son Sean and his daughter -in -law Hirai Rootska held a seminar on discs and dancing.

It wasn't long after this event, I stopped by Gangchon.At the time, I was told that the construction was underway while meeting with animals and human staff.When asked what the construction was, the staff who answered 'no comment and secret' ... I think I heard the answer a while ago.The answer was ... The dog forest, the largest dog theme park in Korea.

July 2019

The summer of 2019 is exceptionally hot.When I stopped by the Chuncheon Songam Lepsports Town, where the 1st KDDN was held in July, it was hot and I played water on the stadium.

Animals and people held the 1st KDDN Championship at the Chuncheon Songam Lepsports Town Assistant Stadium on July 13 and 14.

KDDN is a representative who selects national teams to participate in the international competition hosted by USDDN.For a while, USDDN and KDDN are as follows.

The first meeting online in 2012 and the 2017 Hiraiyachi's Frisbi seminar have been a chance with 'Animal and People'.

I want to give animals and people the nickname 'People who create Korean Doksports Culture'.People who inform people of Doksports, activate the community, and even create the environment so that hobits can work on the world stage!They and they are animals and people.

The know -how and efforts of animals and people that have been accumulated so far are also handed down to companions, and it is hoped that Doksports will be settled as a culture that feels like a walk with a dog.And he writes the central role in anticipation of the animal, people, and dog forests.
