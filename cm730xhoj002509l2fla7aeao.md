On November 6, Ganghwa -gun (Gunsu Yucheonho) held a pet ticket campaign with local residents to create a mature pet culture in Gapryong Park.

The Gapryong Park, which opened in September, has become a loved spot for the people of all ages, but some of the poor mature dogs walk their dogs without filling their collars, and do not collect feces.I often frowned.

In order to create a pleasant Gapryong Park environment, the military is carrying out various promotional activities such as installing pet tickets in the park at the main entrance and promenade, and producing and installing bowel bags.

Myung -Sook Myung -Sook, Director of Forest Park, said, “In order to prevent safety accidents related to pets and to prevent conflicts with dogs, more mature citizens are required.”Please keep the pet ticket so that you don't feel the discomfort. ”
