Yoon Kyung Co., Ltd., a company that studies pet residential culture, introduces the 'elements that the pet house should have' on the website.In the Yajoppet, we look at what these elements are.-Addivier Note-

hello.

Think about the pet's bathroom

In a house with pets, the bathroom is important.Thank you for your guardian if your pet can do your bowel movements in the bathroom.

Of course, guardians' bowel movements are also in the bathroom.

It is good to be a common place used by a guardian and pets, but in general, pets are often reluctant to enter the bathroom.

There are some reasons why pets don't want to enter the bathroom.

Is there any problems such as heating, floors, and access?

First toilet is not well heated.

People also feel creepy when using a toilet on a cold floor.Especially in the case of Nyan, it is true that you are reluctant to be a cold place because you like to cling to a warm place.

Secondly, the slippery floor gives a sense of rejection for pets unfamiliar with.

Unlike foreign environments, Korea is mostly tiled due to the toilet environment that uses water.

Recently, non-slip tiles have been used, but there are also toilets that do not.Cold floors and tiles come to an unfamiliar environment for pets.

Third access is not easy.The toilet is usually closed, so it is difficult for pets to enter.This is why a private door pet door (PET-DOOR) is needed.

What do the guardian wants?

From the guardian's point of view, the shape of the desired toilet is not limited to the pet first and exit.And I want to be a smooth structure in bathing pets.

Dogs regularly take a dog.Of course, a cat is also good for your guardian and for your health.But if you don't like water, it's a good idea not to force you to groom yourself.

A dedicated option adopted by pet pet petheim

As a result, Petheim has several dedicated options in the bathroom.

First, the toilet floor heating allows guardians and pets to use the toilet warmly without rejection.The temperature in the toilet that is not different from the room is not rejected to enter.

Second, the floor uses a non -slip finish.

It is safe, safe and safe for pets to use.Install the tiles or dedicated topx for non -slip processing.

Third, we have a structure that is easy to take a bath.

You may install a private shower for baths for your pets, and if you need it, you may have a pet -only bath tube.

Fourth, install the pet door if necessary.

In the case of the toilet, I prefer the pet door form that is installed on the door rather than the permanent pet door installed on the existing walls.

Fifth, we have a dedicated ventilation device.

If you use it as a bowl of pets, one of the troubles is odor.Install a dedicated ventilation utensils so that the smell of the toilet can be discharged to the outside without opening the door.

These options can be applied optionally depending on the environment of the house, and also have pet goods storage space.

Petheim is trying to develop pet residential culture

These small considerations allow pets and guardians to live in a healthier and more comfortable environment.We will lead the residential culture that pets and guardians can be happy together.thank youNon -hole!
