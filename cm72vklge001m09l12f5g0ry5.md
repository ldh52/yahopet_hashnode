Ganghwa -gun (Gunsu Yoocheon -ho) announced on the 13th that it will proceed with the “Light Dog Disease vaccination project” for the safety of the citizens until the 27th of next month.

Rabies are mainly infected with dogs through wild animals and can be transmitted to humans.The fatality rate is high during infection, and dogs raised at home must be vaccinated once a year.

Vaccination can be given at all times at the designated animal hospital within the free vaccination period, and the business trip is conducted on the date designated by the airborne doctor by town and village office.

Residents who wish to be inoculated with dogs for more than three months of age in the office can visit the designated animal hospital close to the house or a designated place for each village.In particular, this time, the company plans to visit the dates for the designated date for seniors who are uncomfortable.

The vaccination of rabies is carried out twice a year in the second half of the year, and the military plans to support the entire amount of inoculation costs of around 20,000 won to overcome the 19 -year -old corona and increase the vaccination rate.

A military official said, "Rabies are an infectious disease that can be transferred to people, so be sure to inoculate for your family and neighbors."
