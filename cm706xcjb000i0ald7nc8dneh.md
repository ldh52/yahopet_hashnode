Elanco Animal Health Incorporated (NYSE: ELAN) today unleashed a multi-faceted educational campaign - declaring today as the first-ever National Parvo Awareness Day, aimed at bringing awareness to this devastating and often-fatal puppy disease. As part of this effort, Elanco is releasing Parvo is Poop - an eye-catching campaign highlighting the way the virus spreads, the symptoms and the breakthrough solution to treat canine parvovirus (parvo).

The goal of National Parvo Awareness Day (April 23) and the Parvo is Poop campaign is to shine a public light on parvo with eyebrow-raising creative and activations that puts the conversational topic of dog poop front and center. Parvo, one of the most contagious and deadly viruses for dogs and puppies, is spread mainly through contaminated dog feces. The virus is resistant to heat, cold, humidity and drying. It can sometimes survive in the environment for years and, in some cases, isn't even removed when poop is scooped.

By sparking much-needed dialogue about parvo, Elanco hopes to encourage the public to be vigilant, especially during parvo season.

Today - April 23 - marks the beginning of the parvo season, when dogs and puppies are most susceptible. Although it strikes throughout the year, late spring and summer are the most common seasons for parvo outbreaks and data shows active web searches around this misunderstood virus significantly spike.

"Parvo is exhausting, devastating and scary - it's just crappy, in every sense of the word," says Dr. Jennifer Miller, technical veterinarian, Elanco. "That's why I'm so proud of the work Elanco is doing to increase education and conversation about the grave consequences of parvo. There are simple steps we can take right now to help save puppies."

Last year, hope emerged when the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) awarded conditional approval to Elanco's Canine Parvovirus Monoclonal Antibody – the first and only targeted treatment for canine parvovirus. In a treatment efficacy study, zero parvo infected dogs died (or succumbed to the infection) when they received the monoclonal antibody as their treatment. Additionally, there's evidence that the treatment may help shorten the course of the virus, so puppies feel better faster and get home to their families sooner.

As a result, today Elanco also introduces the first-ever online parvo tracking tool empowering pet owners and the veterinary community with game-changing intelligence to further help keep puppies safe. Visitors to ParvoTrack-powered by Elanco can self-report and identify parvo outbreak areas in real time, with a few simple steps. Dog owners and the veterinary community can also sign up at DefeatParvo.com to receive alerts with outbreaks in their area as well.

While vaccination is the cornerstone to disease prevention, here are three additional steps we'll focus pet owner educational efforts on this parvo season:

"Raising awareness about parvo and encouraging every veterinarian to keep innovative Canine Parvovirus Monoclonal Antibody in their freezer can be transformative in defeating this deadly disease," said Bobby Modi, Executive Vice President, U.S. Pet Health, Elanco. "It requires us to be innovative and bold. The first-of-its-kind tracking tool is something that we've heard loud and clear from the veterinary industry is critical - if we can track and test for parvo, we can treat for and defeat parvo by using Elanco's innovative Canine Parvovirus Monoclonal Antibody. By raising awareness – and a few eyebrows – we can help achieve our goal of saving 1 million puppies from dying from canine parvovirus by 2030."

The campaign is just the latest effort of Elanco's multi-year Defend Puppies. Defeat Parvo. bold mission to save 1 million puppies by 2030. Elanco also established the Parvo Defenders Task Force earlier this year with the likes of animal health leaders, such as MARS Veterinary Health, IDEXX, Nextdoor, PAWS Chicago, Austin Pets Alive, Fear Free and others, to champion acts that undercut parvo and curb this endemic.
