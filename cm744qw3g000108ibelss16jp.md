Middle Asian of Chaka is also different, and it seems to be Separd in the name of a breed.

Turkish Sepford Dog!

I looked at a Kennel homepage in KörfEz Kennel, but it doesn't touch what kind of breeds.

I'm looking at the homepage, saying that Anatolian Sepford is called Turkish Seper.

Turkmen Shepherd Dog comes out,

Turkish Shepherd Dog = Anatholian Sepford,

I don't know if Turkish Shepherd Dog and Turkmen Shepherd Dog are the same.

It is said to be the best with guard dogs and shepherd dogs, but it is not usually utterly even if you look at the physique.

Looking at the Facebook video, you can see the movements of these friends.Türkiye also has these wonderful dogs.

In a sense, I feel like it's similar to Korean traditional dogs I saw in the last sewage.Our sewage dogs seemed to be very big.

I would have said that if I had been named ObCarra, I felt a little unusual because the name of Sepherd was at the end.

I think it's clear that Anatolian Sepford Dok is called Turkish Sepford Dok, and I introduce two related videos.One is a sheep dog, and the other is a therapy poison that changed the life of a boy.
