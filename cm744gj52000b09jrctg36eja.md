It was in May 2017 that I first met Kim Eun -bi Breeder of Laon Jena French Bulldog.At the time, Kim Breeder was when he participated in the KKF & FCI Dog Show in Daegu and just returned to Hongcheon's house.

At the time, Kim Breeder said, â€œThere is still no understanding of breeding in Korea, so I have been misunderstood by those around me.I think it's a reality that the pet culture is not being chased in the dog show.

This is the word that Kim Breeder told me about the culture of 'breeders' and 'dog show', which can still sound unfamiliar to the general public.

Kim Breeder is Hongcheon, Gangwon -do.In 2018, Kim Breeder and Beans listened to the news online, and in 2018, Kim Breeder opened a cafe called 'Black Bean'.A year after the first meeting, I stopped by black beans, and I was able to capture Kim's video on the screen.

In June 2019, I was able to meet Kim Breeders at the KKF Pet Festival held in KINTEX, Goyang, and invited students to the Breeders and Dog Show by inviting them as an invited instructor to the Early Bird Program Pet Care and Class.

Kim Eun -bi Breeder, who is participating in overseas dog shows as well as in Korea, is active as a professional breeder.

This year, I was active in the dog show, but I couldn't see her online because I couldn't visit the site due to the influence of Corona 19, but I was able to hear the news online.

When I first met Kim Breeder, I remember the story of 'I don't have enough understanding of breeding in Korea, so I can be misunderstood by people around me.'Three years have passed, but the culture of breeders and breeding has not been introduced to the general public.

There are also a lot of pet -related departments, and there are young people who try to put 20 youths in their 20s like Kim Eun -bi.Their enthusiasm and effort concludes in anticipation of changing the perception and culture of breeders and dog shows.
