The slogan of 'Daiso' is 'National Shop'.With its excellent marketing, it has become the most successful company among offline living stores.Last year, the company posted sales of 2 trillion won in more than 1,300 stores nationwide, so it is a myth of 1,000 won.It is still strong in the online market.Like the brand name, all household goods are all in the pet supplies.

So how many pet supplies are there in Daiso near Gangnam -gu Office, the center of Seoul?To solve that question, I looked into Daiso Gangnam -gu Office.Gangnam -gu Office Station was quite large in the history of Gangnam -gu Office.

The product is displayed

The pet supplies corner occupies three shelves, 90cm wide and 240cm high.The middle shelf of the shelves was divided into 8 squares every 30cm intervals.

The product is asserted from the basic items, from feed to various care products.Of course, it is natural that there is a lack of diversity compared to professional pet shops.The products were branded in professional pet shops, but most of them were brands that seemed to be an OEM in Daiso.This is because the price and capacity of Daiso reflect the characteristics of Daiso.

Feed and snacks

The three shelves were displayed in the order of cats, public and dogs, respectively.It was a feed that was noticeable, so I saw the manufacturer.Cands were made by Sajo and Dongwon, and snacks were also noticed by Japanese products such as Dogi Man and Cateman.The traces of the Daiso Pet supplies manager to catch both prices and quality are powerful.

Daiso Gangnam -gu Office Station is located in the center of Seoul.The pet product corner here was not much bigger than the reporter thought.The pet supplies corner will continue to expand in the future, or whether it will end up with a phenomenon, and whether it will end with assortment.
