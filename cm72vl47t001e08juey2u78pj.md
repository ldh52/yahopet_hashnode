This is Kim Young -hwan, who was appointed as a representative of care in September.

Greetings to Care members.We also greet everyone who opposes the pain of the animal and supports the freedom of the animal.

Care has been the most active in the front line of the animal protection movement over the past 18 years.Dog farm and slaughterhouse closure activities and large -scale structures are like a symbol of care.The Jangsu -dong hell case, which was resolved by Care in 2006, has been revised the enactment animal protection law, which was only a name, in 15 years, and created an animal protection guard system and a taunt -based isolation measure.

In 2011-2012, we conducted a national survey of the nationwide on -the -sized field through the tracking and infiltration, and the dog meat festival, which was about to start from Seocheon, canceled it as an active activity beyond the current law.It might have been spreading.

Investigations and exposing of the first nation's first national sanctuary management status have resulted in the laws of local government shelter facilities and operating standards, and since then, the steady investigation and policy requests for animal abandonment have been punished.

We first informed society about the problem of animal hoding, and so far, more than 500 animals have been rescued from Horder and proposed effective regulations.He first exposed the unknown public blood dogs, opened the first adoption center in Korea in the Mecca of Pet Shop, and played a big role in preventing the indiscriminate mouthpare policy for dogs.

We rescued cows, deer, black goats, geese, crocodiles, horses, and donkeys, and continued to promote the lives of various animals such as experimental animals, and tried to revise the relevant laws.We presented an alternative model for animal rights, such as opening.

He has been a disaster relief work, and has been able to monitor the killing site of killing for more than 10 years, monitor the killing site, and expose the status of the live store throughout the world to actually prohibit the burial of mammals.Animal rights education was conducted and care education center was established to cultivate regular training.

Representative Kim Young -hwan held a meeting to discuss animal rights and welfare through the monthly animal law comparative research group.

But have animals' lives better over the last 18 years?

There are still no laws to prohibit the edible dog industry, and the number of livestock that is slaughtered and slaughtered in pain is continuously increasing, and more than 1.1 billion animals are slaughtered.

The number of animals sacrificed by experiments increases, the intensity of the pain they suffer is getting worse, and the destruction of habitats due to the climate crisis is driving wild animals to extinction.

A prominent animal jurist Stephen Wise summarizes the 50 -year history of the American abuse law, and the penalties for animal abuse have been strengthened, but the scope of law has been reduced.However, because the area exempted from the application of the law is an abuse in the industry, such as livestock industry, which has a large number of abuse.

The same is true of Korean animals in the last 18 years.In order to improve the conditions of life of animals, care struggled to break the body, but the situation in which the animals are being exacerbated is getting worse.In order to turn the situation, the animal movement must be much more powerful than it is now.

Only when the animal movement is powerful, politicians, bureaucrats, journalists, and intellectuals are more interested in the interests of animals than the benefits of the industries using animals, so that the law will intervene in the industry.What is most necessary for the animal movement to be powerful is that devoted, wise, and competent activists are mass -produced in the animal movement.At the forefront of their lead, there are people who face the abusers in the field where animals suffer.

Care will produce activists who oppose animal pain and support the freedom of animals, and build a net that moves the world in the direction of animal liberation in various parts of society.

As a representative of care, I present the “community of activists for animal liberation” as the second care of the second care.

In the past, care was ahead of anyone in exposing the field of animal abuse, rescued animals, and developing animal campaigns.In contrast, the aspect of the management of the group was vulnerable.A lie about euthanasia is one example.Former President Park So -yeon apologized, and his successor Kim Kyung -eun also apologized, but I also apologize for this serious problem that damages the trust between members and society.Furthermore, I will find and resolve the administrative flaws that have become soil that can occur.

Now care should be summarized after 2019 and a leap forward than before confusion.

Please support the second care.

And please.

It will be care for the end of the dog's slaughter and to speed up the liberation of animals.
