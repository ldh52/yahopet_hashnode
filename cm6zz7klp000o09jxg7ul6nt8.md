The industry leader in off-site airport parking, Park 'N Fly, has announced the launch of a comprehensive promotional campaign featuring their new virtual and real-life company representative the "Park 'N Fly Guy."

This campaign was developed after performing internal employee and external customer research that overwhelmingly identified the desire for a brand campaign that embodies the company's long-standing commitment to stress-free travel and a positive airport-parking experience for business and leisure travelers alike.

이 캠페인은 스트레스 없는 여행에 대한 회사의 오랜 노력과 비즈니스 및 레저 여행객 모두에게 긍정적인 공항 주차 경험을 구현하는 브랜드 캠페인에 대한 열망을 압도적으로 파악한 내부 직원 및 외부 고객조사를 수행한 후 개발되었다.

Park 'N Fly's customer experience is highly dependent on the interaction with shuttle drivers, cashiers and valet-parking assistants, and these on-site employees served as the inspiration for the Park 'N Fly Guy's friendly, enthusiastic, musically-inclined persona.

Since shuttle drivers are usually the first-person customers see when they get to the airport and the last-one they interact with before they get home, there was no doubt The Park 'N Fly Guy had to represent each and every employee who plays a part in the company's exceptional customer service. Friendly and enthusiastic like all of the team members at our parking facilities and behind the scenes, his guitar skills are an added bonus! (Learn more about the Park 'N Fly Guy here.)

The Park 'N Fly Guy is the primary focus of the company's latest campaign that will be implemented across all customer touch-points. The Park 'N Fly Guy will be featured as part of all marketing and promotional platforms, including the company's website, emails, social media ads, brochures, and billboards, as well as wraps on all airport shuttles.

Park 'N Fly Guy는 모든 고객 접점에서 구현될 회사의 최신 캠페인의 주요 초점이다. Park 'N Fly Guy는 회사 웹사이트, 이메일, 소셜 미디어 광고, 브로셔, 광고판을 포함한 모든 마케팅 및 홍보 플랫폼의 일부로 등장할 뿐만 아니라 모든 공항 셔틀의 랩핑이 될 것이다.

Another key component of this campaign is a "jingle" that features The Park 'N Fly Guy and highlights the company's competitive advantage as a whole. Park 'N Fly wanted to give employees an opportunity to share their passion for the company with a contest, and Patty Stevenson, Lot Manager at Park 'N Fly's facility in Dallas, was selected as the winner. Not only is Patty a songwriter on the side, but her husband is also a singer, and together they created the perfect tune that will be used in commercials aired digitally in 2021.
