The fastest of the dogs, Gray Hound!Grayhound hobbyists are gathered in Korea to hold a monthly Gray Hound race competition.During the Mokpo Pet Theme Journey, I meet with the chairman of the Korea Gray Hound Gyeongju Association, the chairman of the Public Relations Committee, and listen to the association.

Currently, there are more than 30 members of the association, and the Gray Hound Racing Competition is held regularly every month except January and July.The place where Gyeongju is held is Jeonbuk Imsil Gray Hound Stadium, famous for its sewage dogs.

The public's visit is welcomed at any time, and if you visit a regular meeting on the day of the Greyhound race, your dog can also run the game track.

Ko Seo -yoon, chairman of the Gray Hound Race, said that he hopes that the Gray Hound race will be activated and one of the poison sports will allow the general public to enjoy dogs.

The activities of the Korea Gray Hound Gyeongju Association can be found on the next cafe (http://cafe.daum.net/skgr).
