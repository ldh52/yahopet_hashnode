Sony's robot puppy is upgraded day by day.

Thanks to the update of the software, Ivo can expect the owner to expect it, and when the owner arrives, he can wait calmly at the door.

According to the Sony homepage, at first the owner should specify a place where to meet with Aibo in front of the door, and say, "Where you should be here."

Then Ivo nods and nods and remembers the place.At the end of this series of procedures, Aibo recognizes the inquiry location through the app.

Theoretically, after this time, if the owner returns home, opens the door and says "I'm home," Ibo will get up and welcome.

Ivo remember the time when the owner would come back and waited at the door.
