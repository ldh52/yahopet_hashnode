Boryeong City announced on the 27th that it has installed a long cat in the vacant lot near the City Hall Happy Complaint Office.The long cat food service is designed to create an environment that can be familiar with animals in everyday life and to establish a right cat protection culture.The food service is made in about 1.6㎡ so that the sanitary food is supplied to a fixed facility to the long cat to find food, and the members of the Boryeong Gil Cat Protection Association (CEO Kim Mi -ok) are in charge of the operation and cleaning of the food service center..It also promotes individual management and neutralization surgery projects (TNR) to reduce the estrus stress of cats and regulate the number of natural cats without natural enemies.Earlier this year, the city has been controlling the number of people by 279 cases and 232 neutralization projects by the end of October.The city expects that the installation of the food service center in the building will help to solve the complaints, such as hygiene problems of the garbage separate collection plant due to long cats, noise problems caused by areas and breeding at night in the city.Mayor Kim Dong -il said, “The long cat food service is a pilot project in which public -private people work together to protect animals and solve social conflicts caused by long cats.”I hope the citizens' active interest to be settled. ”
