Chungju City Council, Cho Bo -young, made a preliminary statement at the 251st extraordinary meeting to prevent environmental pollution by recycling ice packs.

Unfortunately, Corona 19 Fan Demicks are prolonged, and as the distance and personal defense of life are emphasized, many of our citizens' lifestyles are also appearing.

Perhaps the most prominent changes have been made in non -face -to -face and non -contact methods in society as a whole, resulting in a lot of changes not only in our daily eating habits but also in purchasing behavior.

Food orders through the delivery app are flooded.As a result, the amount of disposable supplies is also increasing.According to the online shopping data released by the National Statistical Office in August, 83.0%of food services and 59.3%of household goods were increased by 83.0%and 44.4%of food services.

There is also a change in the form of shopping.Rather than the form of purchases that visit the marts or traditional markets, the number of young housewives ordering on the Internet is increasing, and the usage of fresh foods is increasing.

According to the press release on July 29, the Ministry of Environment announced that it will promote measures to reduce the use of ice packs by activating the reuse of ice packs made with plastic (high absorption resin) and converting filling materials into eco -friendly materials.

About 80%of the ice packs are abandoned in the pay -as -you -go bag and are incineration and buried.In addition, about 15%are discharged into sewers and acts as a cause of microplastics.

Ice pack is made by mixing high absorption resin (SAP) and water. This high absorption resin (SAP) is a kind of fine plastics that do not burn well, absorb the water quickly and do not melt in water at the same time.It is said that it is not easy to dispose of it, but it is not easy to dispose of it.

If the contents of the ice pack are poured into the sink and the packaging is separated, it will flow into the river or the sea, which can cause marine pollution, but also the fine plastics may be on the table through fish and shellfish.

Ice packs can be reused several times, but have been used and discarded like a one -time use.The ice packs produced over the past year are 210 million, which are used in four per national, and this year, it is estimated to be 320 million due to the increase in online shopping.

The ice pack recycling method is said to be used as a pack for steamed steaming by putting it in the freezer and heating it in a cold or microwave.In addition, smells and moisture absorption are excellent, so if you add the fragrance oil in a container, you can use it as a fragrance, or if you place it on the pot, you can maintain moisturizing.

The reuse of the ice pack can reduce garbage, environmental pollution, and waste of resources.In order to increase the recycling method of the ice pack, we need a lot of promotions about recycling methods.

As a methodology, Ice pack collection box is installed in base facilities such as administrative welfare centers and apartments, and through the cleaning process, Ice pack collection box is collected at the traditional market and large marts, and the traditional market or side dish delivery that collects ice packs and sells fresh foods.You will need to create a resource recycling platform to supply and reuse an ice pack.

The number of local governments that recommend reuse by installing ice pack collection boxes nationwide is increasing.

If you collect five ice packs, you will be rewarded for a 10 -liter waste -based bag, and to maximize the effect, you will use local currency next year and expand the collection of collections to marts.In the nearby Jecheon -si, the municipality is directly conducting an ice pack collection project through the Ministry of Public Administration and Security.

In Chungju, citizens who are trying to minimize the environmental damage caused by 'ice pack' are moving voluntarily, and since August, more than 700 ice packs that were collected, drying and ethanol disinfection were collected in August 7th.It was delivered to restaurants in the market, Juduk mushroom farms, and animal drug handling businesses, and citizens' response was explosive.

Chungju -si should also use the recycling collection boxes that have been used to collect ice packs and recycle them to prevent environmental pollution and reduce waste of resources.

While looking at the national cases, we will watch the video of resource recycling using the waste breeding film in Gyeonggi -do in the news on July 5th.

It is expected to reduce both the waste meter and the ice pack, and the reduction of resources and environmental protection will be great due to the expansion of recycling of reuse items.

We also proclaimed the clean area of ​​garbage in February.

If you can reduce the waste in your life by recycling not only the ice packs mentioned today as a oil prestigious resource, as well as the ice packs mentioned today, you will be reborn as a city of flowers and light and eco -friendly cleaning city.I think it can.
