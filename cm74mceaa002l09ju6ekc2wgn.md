I went to a dog playground in Boramae Park in Seoul.As you enter Boramae Park, you can see people walking with dogs not only on the dog's playground but also in Boramae Park.

Boramae Park parks a car in a public parking lot and walks inside the park.From the entrance, there is a dog playground at 11 o'clock.There is a distance to see the scenery and walk to the playground.

The difference with the children's park dog playground, which was heard last week, is a 'dog access restriction' at the entrance to Seoul Grand Park through the Gumun Parking Lot.Dogs are allowed to enter the playground only.However, in Boramae Park, you can see the dogs walking with this companion.

Walk for 5-6 minutes and you can see the dog playground.Arrive at the playground and go inside and walk out.

The playground was divided into two with large dogs and small and medium -sized dogs.There is also a banner that operates a playground for 24 hours.Another thing that stands out is the isolation room, where the dog is leaving a dog when he leaves for a while.

There is a notice, and you can see the phrase 'accessory guide'.There is a description of the mouth of the mouth and the disabled dogs.I looked at it.

Based on the wearing of the mouth, the large breed (Jindo, Husky, Shiba, Doberman, Tokyo, Sepodan, Pungsan, and other) is determined that there is a risk of risk.

Entrance Dogs (Article 12 of the Enforcement Regulations of Animal Protection Act).Dogs of the dogs. Rott, Iller and its hybrid dogs 6.

Looking at the contents of the notice, it seems that the standards have been set somewhat excessively.Compared to the contents of the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, the Enforcement Decree and Enforcement Rules of the Enforcement Rules, the above contents were set.

The contents of the amendment shall not escape from the place where the dogs are raised without owners.It contains the back.

▶ The dog playground is a space designed to allow dogs to play freely in a space with fences.However, according to the above information, a large dog, which is equipped with the mouth of the mouth, must be a large dog, which is the standard of wearing the mouth.In addition, the dogs corresponding to the dogs are not allowed at all.

▶ In the case of blind dogs, it is appropriate to post a notice on the mounting of the mouth of the mouth inside the playground rather than 'not entering the playground'.According to the purpose of the dog playground, even if you come here, even if you are a large dog and a blind dog, you should be able to play with you.

It was cold, but you can see the dog's dog.The sun went down a lot while looking around the playground.Looking inside the playground, the trees are visible.These trees are likely to create shades for dogs and companions in hot summer.

Boramae Park dog playground where dogs can play freely!In addition to the interior of the playground of the dog, the environment of the Boramae Park itself, which can walk with dogs, is impressive.However, I am sorry to see the 'mouthplain mounting criteria' and the playground 'not entered' at the dog playground.'If you come to the dog playground even if you are a dog, you can play with the surrounding dogs and the space.'I write with a personal desire.
