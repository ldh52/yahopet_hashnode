Article 120 (2) of the Swiss Federal Constitution has the following provisions of 'dignity of creatures'.

'The Federation defines the law on the use of embryonic and genotics of animals, plants and other creatures.Through this, the Federation respects the entire life of all living things, human, animal, environment, and safety, and protects the genetic diversity of east and plant species. '

The seminar discussed the provisions of the Swiss Federal Constitution with the presentation of the presenter.

Among the contents of the presentation, there is an interesting content of 'the public rescue of factories'.In Switzerland, a public announcement was submitted in 2018, which banned factory livestock, which is being reviewed by the federal government after a referendum.

Participants and the Seminar of the Animal Law / German Law Comparison Society had time to present and discuss their opinions.

△ The concept of dignity in animal protection or animal rights can be abstract, the concept of 'pain' that animals hurt is more specific, and should this concept be the basis for animal protection and animal rights?

- In Switzerland, I am curious about the historical and social background that included the 'dignity of creatures' in the Federal Constitution.
- The concept of dignity should be seen from the perspective of mutual respect and altruism.
- The tribes that hunted like the Indians and the Maori expressed their response to the hunting, but in this case, is dignity in the animals that are the object of hunting?
- The Swiss Federal Constitution is in the middle of the extension of the rights subject to 'human -individual life -whole nature', and it is quite wide in that it can include not only animals but also plants and microorganisms.Can you expand the concept of 'dignity'?

Choi Jung -ho, the presenter of the German Law Research Group, presented the opinions of the attendees, and Kim Young -hwan, the representative of the Animal Law Research Group, explained that the effect of the debate was doubled.

The seminar, co -hosted by the Animal Law Comparison Research Society and the German Law Research Group, was a collaboration of two groups of animal and German laws, and this event was the first to see the provisions of the Swiss Federal Constitution.I will say that significance.

This seminar helped the participants understand how they are looking at 'animal, animal protection, animal rights, dignity' from the point of view of the law, and based on the interpretation of 'dignity of animal life' under the domestic animal protection lawIt was an event provided.

Choi Jung -ho, a presenter of the German Law Research Group, said, "The part you presented will be a great help in future research.I thanked everyone who attended.
