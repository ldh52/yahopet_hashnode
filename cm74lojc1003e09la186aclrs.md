The 2019 Songdo K Pet Fair was held in Songdo Convensia from August 30 (Fri) to September 1 (Sun).While watching the Osan Early Bird Program pet care and students with students and looking for a restaurant around, I found a banner guiding the Nairobi Coffee Restaurant.

In the banner, 'Pats can be entered' with the phrase `` a differentiated space with a large hall that specializes in coffee shops, hand drip, roasting, hwaduk pizza, salad, bakery, sandwich, and pasta! ''Look inside and go inside.

Entering the restaurant, you can see a wide and bright interior.And the representative of the restaurant Lee Shin -dong and the staff who welcomed the guests.

After looking around the K -Pet Fair, they eat the oven pizza for lunch.Two people were shared with a pizza, both the taste, quantity and price of the pizza.You can see the baked oveny pizza indoors with your own eyes, so you could eat more delicious pizza.

While eating pizza, visitors who visited K Pet Fair visited one by one.Of course, it was possible to enter the dog, so I entered the restaurant with my dog ​​and drank coffee and ate.

Spacious interior space, welcome people, bright indoor atmosphere, to eat delicious oven pizza there.I didn't think about it when I came to K Pet Fair.The Nairobi Coffee Restaurant is a place that comes to mind when 'K Pet Fair' is a 'K Pet Fair' to the students who first watched the pet fair.

I've been to a lot of pet fairs, but I never had a meal at the fair.I visited the pet fair, but the memories I want to keep for a long time are likely to eat at the Nairobi Coffee Restaurant.

Next time, if the pet fair is held in Songdo Convensia, of course, you will be stopped by the Nairobi Coffee Restaurant to taste delicious coffee and oven pizza again.It was Songdo Convensia Nairobi Coffee Restaurant, where the guests came from a distance with a bright smile.
